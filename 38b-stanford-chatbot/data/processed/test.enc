You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Why?
Hi.
But
She okay?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Like you care.
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
I just wanted --
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Never
Why not?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Assail your ears for one night.
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Where ya goin?
Forget it.
He always look so
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
That's what you want, isn't it?
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Kat! Wake up!
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Do what?
BIANCA
You 're so --
Wholesome.
Good call.
How?
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You tell me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
You think?
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What?!
I missed you.
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
Tumescent!
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Are we going to argue?
You don't usually ask.
What is it, now?  Tell me...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Thousands.
... and also to bring medicine.
He understands.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
What do you read?
You bring the cigarettes?
No.  No way.
What else do you need?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
No.
Do you have coffee?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
A cop?
Oh.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Who did cause and origin?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
But Chief?  Over this??
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Takin' a bath.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Hmmmm.
This isn't homicide school.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
I'm serious here.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Stop it.
Yeah.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Where's Czech girl?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
This all you want?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
What?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Credit?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
As a plumber?!
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
No way!  He's mine!
He knew all along.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
CONTINUED
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Yes, I thought so.
Good morning. How's it going?
Two more.
Yes, I know.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
CONINUED
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Any clue as to what it is?
Any ideas about the colour?
Thank you.
I see.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Now how's your memory doin'?
I ain't tired yet.
Whaddya mean, buy?
I never paid for it in my life.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
What's the matter with my place?
You lying son of a bitch...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We eat when I say we eat.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
You made that move, huh?
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Where's the goddamn car?
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
What the bell happened?
Doesn't look like it.
A cop...
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Thanks for the coffee.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Hello.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Tell me.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Yeah, old times.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Five.  On credit.
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Do you love her?
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
Uh... at least fifty.
...Priest...
Other than that... You all right?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
You little sleaze bag!
...Hi.
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
You know how to fly this thing?
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Apipoulai!
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
You noticed..
You're nothing but a... a...
I'm so very sad.
It's up to you now, Angel!
Tell me...
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Options.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Got it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
I'm not accusing you...
How's the detective business?
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
What do you want?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
A fellow investor.
Machine's in?
What are you... ?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Any good?
Starting to recognize a pattern?
I want his name.
Yeah.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Why?
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
You got absolute zero.
Don't think I won't.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Remember me?
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
There's not much illegal.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Twenty-five.
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
A daughter.
You're learning.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Who is he, his name?
You... you need to go to the police.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Yes, but...
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Those are her belongings.
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
What's wrong?
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Kristen, what happened?
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
Not really.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
Nice neighborhood.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Where is he?
The tickets.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Are you alright?
You do good work, Alice.
Who's Jacob?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
What is it?
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
So they caught up with you, too?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
I guess.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Wonderful!
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
As we near the Pole...
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
Who with?
Right <u>at</u> him?
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
Tell me.
This spring.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
I'm okay.
Safety on?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Like you and Gordon?
Bastard's got his high beams on.
In the chest.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Yeah. It's stupid.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
How about a Big Mac?
I know.
You're a policeman.
I figured you already heard.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You and Mel Gordon?
Could be.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Mel Gordon.
Said what?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Oh, Wade.
You've been married twice --
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
Going somewhere, Margie?
It makes me sad.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Where... how'd you hear that?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
In the living room.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Bang!
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Twombley.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Who?
What about Margie?
A hunting accident is perfect.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
Daddy...
Do you see the maintenance panel?
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
The rest of the secret service?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
What are you doing?
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Thank you for calling the white House...
I might still have a few chips left.
Shit.
What is it, Mary?
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Request; life support systems check.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I love you, Elaine.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
See them, Elaine?
Airsick?
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
How ya doing, honey?
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
What is wrong?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Did you talk to him?
Tell me.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Was.  Divorced.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
Why?
What was that about?
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
How potent?
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Uh, George...
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
But there's no more drug.
Who else can I ask around here?
Departmental policy.
What?
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
I get the picture.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
That the atmosphere processor?
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
I don't know.
I told them to fall back...
Sir?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Save it.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Fifteen meters.
Terrible.
What did you say?
Why not?
Where is she?
Come on.  Crawl faster.
Look, I told you...
Good morning.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Is there a part for me?
Where?
In a harem.
A brothel.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Is she a good fuck?
Sir -
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
You have leave to try.
Humiliated?
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Where?
Now?
Why? People fart backwards.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
What?
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
There's a young girl to see you.
Well, ask her!
Stanzi!
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
No one.
Frau Mozart?
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Come back tonight.
But! I'm a married woman!
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
How much will you pay him?
Where's our friend?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
When, may I ask?
He's adorable!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Really?
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Yes, where?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Yes, Sire.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Yes, what about him?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
That's not what I hear.
Yes.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Really? What is it he's writing?
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Where does he work?
What medicine?
I don't know. He has pains.
Is he working?
Opera? Opera!
Sssh!
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
Of course not.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
You burned the score?
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
What dead? Who is dead?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Exactly.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Mozart -
Herr Mozart -
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
What do you want?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
Leave me alone.
Well?
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
Did you try?
You cannot say that!
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
Yes?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Exactly.
Where?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
What do you mean - now?
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
The American? Yes, duck.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Yes.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Surely you're not suggesting...
Yes, I should think so.
No, a cab will be faster.
How old are you?
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
That's easy enough.
What?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Are you better now?
Your dead friend Jack?
Bathroom.
I should be committed.
Jack is dead!
No.
Miss Price.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
I really don't know.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
It's moving.
I can't stand it.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
Jack, are you really dead?
I could hang myself.
Do you have any hot soup?
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I
Where you been?
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
What good will that do?
We want to talk to you.
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Doesn't that come next?
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Why are you so anxious?
Why, Cyril, you're insane
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Mr. Sampson . . .
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Well, I
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
If he can do it, yes.
You're lying!
The lobby's half filled now.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
He's at a board meeting.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Oh, Charlie again.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
What time did you get in?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
How?
What have you done?
I ain't done --
Damn!
What?
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
I got seven thousand.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
Yep.
A bad idea.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Well?
What the --
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
On account of we're robbing it.
Distracting enough for you?
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
You are a charmer.
She's still talking to Jesus.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
Don't care.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
This has been a good year.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
We're doing this for Ma.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
That he was.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Riders --
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I beg your pardon?
But I like the presidential suite.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
Now let's have a drink.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Well, not exactly.
I think so.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
How can that be?
Good.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
What is that?
That.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
So you can't tell me anything?
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
Are we here?
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
It's a plain end. I think.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Take it off.
Why?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Nothing like last time, promise.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Really?
I don't want to talk about it.
Are you using minoxidil?
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Where are you going?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Are you my two o'clock?
You saw the ad in the Times?
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
Uh huh.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Patrick?
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Oh? And what should I say?
Patrick?
Patrick?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Sorry. 
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Well...
No. I really don't.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Oh no, I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
How old are you?
Bad habit.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Oh.
People just...disappear.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Well, I could he wrong.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
No hash browns?
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Marcus?
I'm so hungry.
Listen, what's your name?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
He wasn't acting?
Milo?
My goodness.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
...Hello?
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
...Do I?
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
I'm sure.
I heard what happened.
I meant did you find other stuff to --
You could've handwritten it.
Okay, #2.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
What about the FBI?
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Oh.
I met this girl.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Be careful.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Right away, Exposition.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Yes Basil?
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Sure.
What?
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
I'm sure.
He's too well-protected right now.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
I don't get it.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Does that make you horny?
Not a good time to lose one's head.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Are you crazy?
Kiss me.
Danger's my middle name.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
What are you saying, son?
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
Hi.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
What did you say?
You didn't...
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
We don't label people here, Scott.
Really?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
... love...
You
You are female?
Rules are made to be broken.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Steed, we really must be --
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
I wasn't about to.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Do you always drive this fast?
This must be the last straw.
You lied.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
Where are you going?
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
You don't believe him?
Decontamination -- ?
You're not venturing alone, surely.
How did you guess?
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Amnesia?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Walk over to the window ...
John Steed.
You're better than I expected.
One shot -- for emergencies.
That's not playing by the rules.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
I've decided not to run for President.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
I'm marrying Debbie.
The best.
Hello?
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
It looks awful.
Are you going to have women at your party?
What's the matter?
Good...
Yes...
I hope Ilene's all right.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Give him the works.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
You're a pimp?
I want women.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
You okay?
Really?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
I'm separated.
Under the table!
Right in there, pal.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
My Debbie?
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
In the Field Museum once.
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Hey! You don't know me --
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
-- What are you doing here?
How do you know?
-- What were they doing there?
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
I don't guess.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Are you going public with this?
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
Just wondering.
So what do you want me to do?
Your brother was a good man.
Yeah.
Four months.
Four months?
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
I have a job.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Engine 115, right?
So, you surviving without me?
Management were pin heads.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
Okay.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
What's wrong?
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Who's this?
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Did he tell you how we finally met?
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
Who?
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
Yes, Sister?
He gots to be did.
YEAH!
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
I'm not smiling.
Seconds and thirds, too.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
What are you talkin' about?
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
No offense.
We was coming to see you.
What do I have to do?
Why?
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
What do you want?
Good woman.  I trained her right.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
We both lied to him.
For what?
This is crazy.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
He, I'm Mona.
Same thing Giuliani said.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Regardless, he still is your father.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Yes you!
So what's up with you and DeLa?
What do you mean?
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
Oh her.
...aconite get it dat cheap.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...like grits and butter...
I fell out of my bed last night.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
I feel a song a comin' on.
Oh you do, huh?
Never read a book in my whole life.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Why don't you call him?
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Good day to you, young sir.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
What is your uncle's name?
O'Grady.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
The coward!
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Certain?
That is a trifle strong.
Have you not a man whom you value?
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
How so?
To make me wretched in two weeks.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Papa?
Is he all right, papa?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Who?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
There's no need...
Some.
That son of a bitch.
And he'd been shot.
Where?
How do you know that?
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Whose blood is that, Jay?
You're the only one missing a grenade.
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
How are you?
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
And the problem is you only got three.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You're drunk --
You knew Sergeant West?
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
That was kid gloves?
Dunbar.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
We were close to something with Kendall.
Hardy, what are you doing --
This isn't the time --
West?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
I don't think I want to hear this --
So you took off your shirt?
What happened with Nunez?
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
So?
You want Kendall, don't you?
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Who is she? Where does she live?
Yes.
Then do it.
You get the eye?
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
What did she look like?
Really?
Okay.
What did she say?
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
You owe me three-fifty.
I will.
You know where the chemicals are?
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
'Fraid so.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Mmm.
Do you love your father?
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
Of course.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
It's enough isn't it?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
What did he say?
Yes. I know.
Right.
No.
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Yes.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
I don't want to know.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
So what are you going to do?
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
I do. I want to very badly.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
I don't want to talk about him.
Why not?
Shut up. I'm not listening.
And? What are you saying?
And. It's wrong.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes.
Sometimes which?
You...
You don't have to say anything
Please. Why not?
It's not mine either.
It's a long way to go for a date.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Hey.
Hey.
No, ma'am.
Still need a lift?
Yeah.
What happened?
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
The fuck you been doin' to me?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
I don't fuckin' cook.
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Where you gonna be?
Looks like you know a song.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Huh?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
You get a call from Rose?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
Then what?
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
That's right.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
You feelin' sick?
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
I think she got to you, pappy.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
What are you doing?
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Short shift?
You must leave?
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Yakuza.
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
What...?  Why?
Big enough.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Joyce?
Gaiijin?
Where's Ich?
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
Who am I supposed to be?
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Not in that company.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
Why me?
Because I want you to tell me.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
What generation are you?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
You could help us.
What's going on down there?
When?
Yeah.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
No.  I got a problem.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
Nerves of steel.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Huh huh.
What if you change your mind?
Why didn't you go?
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
I'd never get an abortion.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Yeah.
I can imagine.
I told you I'd come back.
Do you dream?
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
You know what I think?
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Yes.
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
What desert?
But how come I'd be there?
You want to go home?
They left.
Hi!
Oh, now, that's a great one!
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
So far?
Right.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
I haven't brushed yet.
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
See, ya.
Doing what?
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
The big one!
When do you need her by?
Could we talk about that a little later?
Now, get out!!
Sure.
In the house?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
May I please be excused?
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Okay. I like that.
You wanted to see me!
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
Adam?!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
There.
Sing it to me.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
What?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Uh-huh.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Why not? He has great pants.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
So, did you buy a movie?
Thirty-five.
Help you?
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Yes?
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
Are you in trouble, son?!
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
What about relatives?
All back East.
Yeah.
Well, put it down and come in!
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
How long will we have to stay down here?
Thirty -five years!
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
In the generator room again?
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
I knew you'd like him.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Alright, I will.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Where are you going?
Yes, you do.
What?
What's wrong?
Yeah! That's thinking.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Buy it from me?
Wolf One -- say intentions.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
Then you got undressed.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Yes, I like you.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Yes.
You like to open me, don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Sometimes I think I do.
I did. Are you?
Yes.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
MOMMY!
Look at these. What are these?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
No thanks. What does that mean?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Am I bothering you?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
He got a little jealous.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
What is it?
No.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
I need Il Duce.
What?
You think they sold me out? No way.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
What?! What are you doin'?
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
Fuck!
me up the...
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
I'm serious.
Nervous?
Oh, we're good man.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
She was in here when it went down.
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
It was... It was...
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
Oh my god!
Promise me boys.
Roc. You okay?
So?
Worst day of my life, man.
We'll keep going, Roc.
You believe?
I guess not.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Making Hutch David Soul?
OK. That's wrong.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
He says. This is he.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
That sets it off.
Eight dollars.
But he didn't say anything.
Loop around real fast.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Where's the manager?
Where's the other stocker?
Holy shit.
Yeah.
What's wrong with him?
Look at the treads on those.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
Sixteen dollars.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
You could give somebody a concussion.
Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
Roger.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
What's happening? What's going on?
What?
Pretty much everything.
What do you mean?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
No. I'm not.
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
What?
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
Yes, he did.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Are you serious?
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Was Future Man adopted?
Yeah. Let's keep it --
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Yeah.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
What do you mean?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Bob.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
Did we get it?
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
You don't even know his name.
What's his name?
Come on in. What you been up to?
He's having a heart attack or something.
Here we go.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Why?
Well, I think --
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
How's the weather down there?
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
The world needs dreamers, son.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
There was a mistake.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
And the Landy woman?
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know about Treadstone.
I want to know what happened.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
Excuse me.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Sorry to wake you.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- what? --
I'll get the book.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
But it ends up the same.
You hear me? I believed you.
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
What's that?
-- go -- take the van! --
This is everything? Is there.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
He won't come.
I rest.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
You'll move
A common thief.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
You've been here before?
Did it work?
I... accept your proposal!
Then when?
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
How do you know this?
Why did you?
You will die! It will be awful!
I am trying.
They've tricked us.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
What is it?
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
I... I blacked out.
Please, mom. People will talk.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
What did you see? What did it look like?
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
Oh God... what did we do?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
It was a long time ago.
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
What do you mean?
What's happened to you?
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Where are we going?
Then you think it might have worked out?
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
...yes.
Evan Treborn.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Listen to me good, Evan...
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Huh?
Meant no offense.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Shut up, Tommy!
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
I came with Captain Renault.
So you decided to go to America.
Does he know that?
Monsieur Rick, I --
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
You haven't heard my offer.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
And Mademoiselle?
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Occupied France?
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
And I was wondering.
That's too far ahead to plan.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Put them on the table.
Hello, Sam.
It's been a long time.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Your work.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Yes. What is it you want?
My bill.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
And that is?
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
But I have no excuse to close it.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Oh, but I just told you. --
Okay.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
I have the letters right here.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Are my eyes really brown?
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
I like it fine here.
No. Not me, boss.
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Get water!
What are you doing?
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
They're on autopilot.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Got to follow the paper path here.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Hey, look at you.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
I have to.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
There isn't any us.
I thought you might have.
Yes, yes he did.
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
Really?
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
The place is falling apart.
Kamal is not here.
I'm touched.
I was making a point.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
Forget it.
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
You're fucking dead!
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Take your time.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
Thanks.  For everything.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
And what did she die of, exactly?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Please don't...
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
Did you grow up around here?
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
I don't think so.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
Of course.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
What's that?
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
The standard ten.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Know who I am, Jake?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Moonan. Here. Shit...
What? I can feel you looking at me.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
You'll be there?
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
How much?
I need you to stake me.
Listen, Scooter --
No thanks. I'm good.
Come on. Harder.
Attractive girl.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Oh Jesus!
That's not --
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Why?
He's gone.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Lighten up.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
Sounds respectable.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
What do we do? We change the scam?
Escorts!
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
King ain't gonna like this.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
What happened?
Can I speak to you in confidence?
That's it?
To who?
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
No. Thanks.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Habib?
I'll try and make it.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
Last hand.
Not entirely.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
I. sold the car.
I've got something to tell you.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Why not?
You're entitled to your opinion.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Yes, I know that.
Don't let yourself down.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Your father?
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
You're serious.
Wait a minute...
I'm sorry.
What for?
Yes.
Hello...
Ross.
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Where to?
How long have you worked at the casino?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Rough day?
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
I put them on together.
Has he?
Where did you go to school?
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
Five.
Girlfriend?
Yes.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
You can start Monday week.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key, goddamit, the key!
It didn't go off.
What the hell?
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
All right, then...
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
Hello, bomb.
Well of course I exist.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Mafhkin oble groop...
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Veil nebula.
-- Remark.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
TALBY!
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
What was that, Doolittle?
Doolittle, hello?
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
How're ya doin', Max.
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Same old story.  Not interested.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Mommy, I'm scared.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
Who is...
Sorry about your window.
Too early to tell.
Girlfriend?
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
I won't be staying.
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
Any idea when she'll be back?
Oh?
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
So are dogs.
Only one I can think of.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Right, the big one-oh.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
Easy Sketchy.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
What are you, high?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
No.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Are you AFRAID?
What was his name?
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Wonder where we'll be then.
Where are you going?
We're moving through time.
Will you please talk to me?
Hey.
My mom is gone.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Grandma Death.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What about your family, Donnie?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
A sign from whom?
How does that make you feel?
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Yes. I went to jail.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
God exists because you're horny.
What is going to happen?
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
Our son just called me a bitch.
Rose.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!
So, what do I say?
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
What is wrong with you?
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
I gotta work with these women.
Oh, Amber...
Amber...
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
You could be quiet.
Loretta, shut it.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
That bitch from...
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
So help me, Gladys.
Becky was my only shot at state!
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
He should be king!
And wear a crown and everything.
The king can do to wrong! 
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
"My dear President"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
What's the matter with you?
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Why wasn't I insulted?
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
She did.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Sure.
It must be done right away.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
You swine!
Once more! 
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
But -
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Our man is sick. Come right away.
What do you mean?
This man belongs in hospital.
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Yes sir.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Good! How is the patient?
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
What is it, Treves?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Good day...!
Have you read it?
You're English.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
Yes.
My name is...
Merrick...
Mmmerrick.
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
The Children. Where are your children
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Good morning.
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
You did this for me?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
No, he's very upset about something.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
HE'S GONE!
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Are you the proprietor?
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
I said welcome.
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
Oh, for goodness' sake!
No!
There is something I must ask the Gods...
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Yes.
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
Louder.
Aaagh! Rape!
Why?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
But...
How deep IS the ocean?
That's terrible!
It's always the women that start the trouble.
Why should WE care?
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
What do you think?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
She hasn't got any.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
That's right.
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
Thorfinn! You can't die!
No... he's not... not... there...
And something to sharpen them with?
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Yeah, you told me that later.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
Come over after I'm done here?
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
What's wrong with me?
How are you today?
Okay, I guess.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
Very much.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
I told her today I need to end it.
You said...
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
What do we do?
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
Me too. There's this poem --
It's dark.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
I just walked in.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I just got in.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
Clementine.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Stan... c'mon...
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
You better go.
How did I look?
And after that?
I know what it is.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
It was a mutual decision.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
The voltage looks fine.
But I don't know how to polka.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
That's Jellybean!
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
What do you think?
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
Time to play Spam in the can.
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
What's happening?
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
Hear what?
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
What happened?
What's wrong?
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
This is Weir.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Peters is right, no one's here.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Alive?
Skipper...
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Explanation?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
Yes...
I don't know...
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
Now what?
Come again, Skipper?
That's an affirmative.
Maybe one of the original crew?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
First time in a grav couch?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
No. I saw nothing.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
We have to do something, oh God...
Hey...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
Explosive decompression.
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
Do they have pressure?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
How long was I out?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
We had a tough year.
Ben --
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
No more cracks about how I look.
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
You're hot!
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Stay right. Left is trouble.
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
But all these people...
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
They're ready for you, sir.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
That's what we're here to find out.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
You want to work at Carl's?
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
It's the first door on your left!
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
I'm just guessing.
Why?
I didn't say that.
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
No.
Any problems?
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Dad says you have to get up!
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
I don't know.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
No. It's too soon.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
How've you been?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
My brother is gonna shit.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
What should I do?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
It was okay.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
Where's Doug?
You just ripped my card in two!
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
You better save some for me, you swine!
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
What's that?
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
Where do you feel like going?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
What do you mean by that?
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
Shoot it.
That's good...
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
That's what gives me The Fear.
I want to leave fast.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
WELL? What are your plans?
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
Some of what?
Right!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
In that case, maybe she can help.
We'll meet in three hours?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
Stop it.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
We're going to get help.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
What's in the back?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Push and twist, it's child proof.
You wanna see, baby?
He only shot you once.
Huh?
Is it gassed up?
Fully.
Four door?
Seven.
What?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Hey!
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
Go! Go!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
Her name is Charlie.
We should stick together out there.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
No, I'm concerned with everything.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Frances.
You don't think I'm good enough?
Right now we have to be practical.
In my eyes, officer.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Were you an alcoholic?
It's already started, Dad... with me.
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Please, Francie...
But, Kurt, I...
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Yeah, well --
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Well? What'd you think?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
You don't know what you want.
Oh no...
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
You're telling me.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
Frances, You're crazy.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Why do you say that?
I'm not sure.
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
What'd you do?
I live here.
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Mama...
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
Why are these all opened?
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
Oh, just leave those things for now.
Yes...?
Don't I know you?
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
What?
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
It can't be as bad as that.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
What can I do?
You will honor your promise to me!
She's not for you.
He always was opinionated.
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
I wish to be your husband.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
You make me weak.
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
I thought I'd never see you again!
What sort of task?
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Professor?
I am not mad.
Quite a few.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
Thank you, Henry.
For what?
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
Preposterous.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
Ah. An explorer.
I heard.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Tomorrow is another day.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
I don't hear it anymore.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
You saved my life.
Thanks.
How about our last jay?
Looks like a storm.
Mmmmmmmph.
Cowboy.
You don't believe in suicide.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Why did they block the door again?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Yes.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Then?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
In the Winnebago.
It's a flop house.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
I'm going for 'em!
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
Do you believe me?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
We have to go back for Daddy!
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
Hot goddamn day!
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
No.
Feels good.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
I'm lookin' scared?
I'm here with you.
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
None at this time, sir.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
See me, sir?
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
Aw, what is this...
Smoke her.
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
Yes?
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
You know him.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
No shortage of suspects.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
You really came back for more?  Of this?
Just askin'
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
You knew about us?
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
Women.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
That why you dumped him?
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
I got pretty close.
...he's pregnant.
Nesting?
You'd be surprised.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
What?
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
I'm sorry about all this.
Merde!
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
We know.
I need you to trust me.
Sure.
What'd they say?
Who the hell are you?
It's Raymond.
I understand.
This is it?
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
You WILL go out there.
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
What the hell is going on?!!?
Shut up.
He's a miserable twit!
Oh my god, It's real.
I don't know.
You said "the Commander.
No I didn't.
Hi Brandon.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
It's okay. Listen-
Yes...?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
There is no weather in space.
Systems register functional.
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
It's suicide.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
It's... I don't know.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
Not a clue. You?
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
But I'm the Commander!
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Thank God. Are you okay?
You should have let me hit him.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
But what if Sarris survives?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
"Deception..." "Lies."
But there it is!...
A model, only as big as this.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
What's going on?
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
Let's do it, Tommy.
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Wil...
No.  I guess.
No, my lord.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
What's your advice, Alexander?
Yes, I believe so.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
You think that?
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
Any word from Canada?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Some things must never change.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
General Greene?
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
It's the freest land on earth.
You're kidding me, right?
What about him?
Trade for what?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
You gave him the money?
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
I'll find it.
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
You positive about that?
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people -
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Who?
You say look at you?
How'd you get in here?
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
I don't like waiting.
I know what a marker is.
I want you to.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
She looks familiar.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
How about this?
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
What's that?
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
...That's what we finally decided.
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
I want to know.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
I don't know.
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
You bet.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
You don't? What happened to Muff?
'We?'
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.
That's what it says.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Where from?
Maureen.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Did you?
Mother fucker!
How long to fix?
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Three, four days.
Sounds like the hull.
Dodge to Murphy.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
You smashed it!
Conveniently enough for you.
Sorry.
You mean, before she sank.
Then why didn't they take it.
Stay away. Or else.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Who?
What guy?
Guess that'd be me. Again.
You just shoot at something?
Same. Any luck?
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
But where's the damage?
What do you think?
Over the gold.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
You got that right.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Call the Coastguard?
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
Morning.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
We could call for help.
Ho-ly shit.
Say what?
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Fifteen, at the most.
What?
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
And what can you tell us about this... 
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
What do you mean?
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
But I was only trying to be friendly...
That guy rules!
Aren't there a million places like this?
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
When did I say I hated you?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Hey Josh.
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Shut up!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
How perfect.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Hi, Al!
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
What is this?
There's my dad with Joanie.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
What was that all about?
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
I didn't get it either.
I don't believe you.
No way... when?
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Don't worry.
So should I come over?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
Why? What did he say?
Nothing.
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
A what?
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
You still interested in that?
Punk rock is over!
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Oh, how "punk."
That tape sucked, by the way!
...are you waiting for a bus?
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Hey, where are you going?
What?
Wow!
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
What about her? Would you go out with her?
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Every guy has a type!
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
Jesus...
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
For nineteen years...
You can open your eyes now.
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Just someone so young...
I had to see you.
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What's the matter?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
Where did you get this?
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
That slut!
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
Very good indeed.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
...one shot...
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
Oh yes, I think so. 
For you.
Thank you, Samuel.
I do, actually; very much.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
He has children?
How many cattle?
Why so many?
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
How is he these days?
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Maybe I should call Janine.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
Can I help you?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Get on with it, counselor!
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
Does it have any favorites?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Eight o'clock?
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
Is that your professional opinion?
No?  What do I act like?
I told you, I ...
All right.
Goodbye.
You're the best one in your row.
Can't you tell me now?
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
What is it?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Nervous?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
I agree.
Gozer.
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
I've got to sleep.
What happened??!!!?
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
What do I say?
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
No sense worrying about it now.
Where are you, Pete?
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Boy, that was a rough one.
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
That's what you told me two days ago!
For the gods, spit it out!
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Then you'd be out of a job.
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
So am I.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
Where is my father?
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
Yes, Caesar?
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
Why you?
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
They fear me.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
My troops don't make policy.
You brought the army into Rome.
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
This is our oil from our estates?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
Do you always drive like this?
Why not?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Benjamin --
Was she married or something?
With a family?
Yes.
Why aren't you ready?
What?
That woman. The older woman.
No -- don't cry --
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
What are you looking for?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
No, Benjamin.
Shhhh.
657-2036
You a student?
You're not one of those agitators?
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
I am going to call the police now.
Mrs. Robinson?
Did you get a room?
What for?
But it's light in there now.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
It's all right.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Thank you.
Why is it?
Benjamin?
How are you?
May I have a drink?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I'll be up in five minutes.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Wood or wire? They have both.
You what?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Are you kidding?
That you're afraid --
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Do you want to hear it or not?
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Man, is this interesting.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Why did you do that?
Well I can't.
Are you shocked?
What?
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
No.
Don't start acting hurt.
If that's how you feel --
You don't have to say that.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
How?
Then you'd better start believing me.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
I do.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
I do.
They don't know?
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
You'll never be young again.
Oh no.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
No, I don't.
That's quite a statement.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
It's a short life and a gay one...
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
No -- no -- no -- no...
What about the money?
Reducing?
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Chasing around.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Strange man...
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
What can you see?
I want to be alone.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
That's a silly joke.
When are you leaving Berlin?
Very early in the morning.
Why later?
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Ready, Kringelein?
All right then.
That was my last.
I've no luck.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
I thought she was splendid!
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Telegrams?
Oh!
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
I'm engaged for the evening.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Please -- please!
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
What is this?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
What?
Cotton Company --
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Hello!
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Yes.
Well?
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Come here. 
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
You've decided against the merger?
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Why not?
It is time for the performance.
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
Yes, the police must be called.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
No. No word.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
I want to keep my teeth.
Bobo, no, I --
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Your what?
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
You want a drink?
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
What? He's going to be all right!
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
But they must be! They cut glass!
Just myself.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
I didn't teach you that.
Scram. Go home.
I can't. I just left home.
Mm?
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Mama!
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
And hello to you, too.
What is it? What's going on?
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Only the real stiffs.
I can be real stiff.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Another historical inaccuracy.
Jimmy, what are you doing?
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Where are you going?
It's an option.
Why not?
Then I'll get caught.
You really think Eddie killed her?
What?
Are you going to leave, too?
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Can't you hold it?
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Mom -- Who is this?
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
What is it this time?
God ... this can't be true.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
It was you.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Home, sweet home.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Go home.
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Go home!
Could have happened to anybody.
The educational process.
You told me.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
Is Penelope in?
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Blue soup.
I've considered that.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
As a matter of fact--
Ask it!
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Uck.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
No, no, no, no, no.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
A hundred dollars!
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
I'm a man.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
No.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Go on.
Yes.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
No you're not!
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Ooops.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
He's dead, you know.
She's fine.  Please--
And her fiancé!
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
None.
You're a son of a bitch.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I'm an honorable clown?
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
Here.  Finish the job.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
No.
It's trash now, like mine.
It was a bitch.
Alice got married again.
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
How horrible.
What will you do, Colonel?
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Premature ejaculation.
Ja?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
What's this?
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
He's alive!
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
That's an interesting piece of news.
I was afraid to ask.
Is Norbert still here?
I don't get it.
I hate that thing.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
That's something I suppose.
Far as I know.
Is he coming home?
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
A what?
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
You mean I'm black?
But is she, has...
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No, I don't.
I'm getting angry.
Just one.
The other girl is the star?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
It's your money. You talk.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
A friend.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
How important do you think sex is?
What's T-J?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
What the crap?
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
They are the same.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
Did you find out where she was?
Where is he?
But then you'll forget about me.
What do you mean?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.
I bought it at a store in L.A.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Do the police want to arrest me?
It's just a name.
What happened, pilgrim?
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
What is it, Jake?
How did you find me?
What plan?
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where!
No.
What you got in mind?
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
It's an investment.
Sounds all right.
What's that?
You never heard of that?
Okay, lady. Out.
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
It's very interesting.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Harold?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
You don't look eighty.
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
What is it?
But what?
Is he all right?
I don't know.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
Yes.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Of course.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Maude.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
It's true. I can't live without you.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
This is insane.
Oh, is this your father?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
A rough estimate.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
Yes.
Thank you, Uncle.
Yes, sir.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
Yes.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Frank.
I knew you'd come.
She certainly has.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Kyle, you don't have...
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Who?
Story of my life.
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
I don't want him.
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
You're kidding --
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Yes?
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
I know.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
You were holding onto it like grim death.
No.
This isn't happening.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
I'm hurting
Well?
A box?
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Maybe.
Don't you care?
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Sure.
How long since you were here?
You're still blaming me.
How are you doing through there?
Julia?
I'll be down in a minute
Oh baby.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
I... suppose so, yes.
Oh Christ.
Who brought me in here?
Who's there?
No Dad.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
He's gone.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
What's the problem?
I thought we'd lost you.
You know I do know the way home.
All right.  No. That's nice.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
What?
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
Nice, Barry.
Oh, so what's the point then?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Suck my ass.
Hey.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
Laura.  Her dad died.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
I have a television.
What?
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks!  About six!
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Hey, Barry.
What are you talking about?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Uh.  That's me.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Yeah.
What's his name?
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
'Morning, Dick.
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Let's not.
What is this.
Shit!
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Nevermind.
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
We'll talk some other time.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
Pigsty.
Pig died.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Look, we can do other things.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Let's go home.  Okay?
C'mon.  I want to know.
What's the difference?
To make you feel better.
Enough, Liz.
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Hi, Marie.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
What do you think?
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Thirteen hundred.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Records are those big round black things, right?
How old is Richard?
He'd want to know about all this.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Who?
You have an active imagination.
He called you "MacLeod".
Is this what you killed them with?
What's all that?
Not all of them.
You want me to front for you.
At least.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
That's insane.
Of bodies.
Will I see you again?
The inheritance.
What are you getting at, Moran?
What were you doing in Felton?
Aye.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
Does it change with me in the room?
He told me there could be only one.
Why?
Impotent cow.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
I am not ready for this.
That is not me.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Tradition.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
My father taught me.
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Kahn?
Long time.
This isn't done.  Get up.
I want you to come to me.
This your present address?
It doesn't.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Your murder weapon?
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Are you back?
Who is it?
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Hildy!
Where'd she go?
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
No. My mother.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
No, I can't.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
He's in the insurance business.
Then what does he want with you?
Allow me.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
Now you're talking!
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
Where do you think you're going?
Huh!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Railroad tickets.
Is he coming back here?
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Sure.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Hildy, darling!
Who do you want?
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Hey!
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
So have we!
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
After all I've done for you --
Just one second --
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
A sight for sore eyes!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
Where's the old lady?
There goes another scrub lady.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
You know it is!
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
What good'll it do?
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
What's from the Governor?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Pinkus.
Get the cops, somebody.
What's your hurry?
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
Give him the you-know-what.
Pauline's mum got killed.
Won't they have maps?
I'm starting my own collection.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
But Dad, It's the News.
You said that last year, Dad.
What's that?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
You need trees for an avenue.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
No Turks.
We all had to write a last letter home.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
Well?
It looks....foreign.
That's it.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
He always knows.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
I can't do it. What's the point?
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
You might still have a house.
I wish it could all have been different.
You're having me on, Molly.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
What?
Ma, Tiny's in.
Who's your Daddy!
How much further?
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Why? You gonna do something about it?
What's this?
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
But suppose for a second you did.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Yeah, no shit.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
It's a hitchhiker.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
I like sleep.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Goddamn.
Fuck your grandmother.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Sleeping.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Tell me about it.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Don't even say it.
What'd we here, Georgie?
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
God damn.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
Firefly.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
Huh?
No, just a little too old.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Please, just a minute.
Tell it to my daughter.
Yes, sir.
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Hello, my little boy.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
French?
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
Well?
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
That's not how he tells it.
We still have you and I.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
My apologies, madam.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
That's what I'm counting on.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
Shut up and tell me.
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
So?
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Be still my crotch.
Yeah. My brother told me.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I'll be in touch.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Oh, and the sun block?
Of course.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
I think he's feral.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Your entire body?
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
That's great. It's a great color for you.
How's work?
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
I think he's ready.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Thanks to you, Nate.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
I want to talk to you.
How?
Are you ready for another?
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Only when I work.
Yeah? Why?
That's your problem.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Where do I sign?
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
What's the matter? What happened?
When do I raise the bet?
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Why?
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Whaddya mean?
Well... well, now.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
Hey, how much are we ahead?
No, it isn't, Charlie.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
I told you you'd get your money back.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Is that what you think?
Now and then. Why, do you?
What time?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Then why go to the bus station?
No, not always.
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
Why did you do that?
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
At school. It's Thursday.
You want to go with me?
You got it all in your head?
Don't you ever cook anything?
You going out?
Who is it?
Would he know?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
You glad?
A week? A year?
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Where's Bert?
He went off someplace.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
I came to play pool, Fats.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
Yes.
Do you remember where it is?
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
I don't know.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Do we have to?
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
Is the hill ours too?
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
Is that all he said?
May I ask why?
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
I'd believe him.
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
I don't see anything.
But it's not, Jimmy.
No one comes here after dark.
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I have school.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
What're you doing?
We're loose!
Where are they?
How're we doing?
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
But what, General?
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
That's impossible...
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Dick-weed.
Your son.
So, what do you do for a living?
No. Exotic.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Damn it!
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
They let you out?
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Venice, Italy!
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
That doesn't look much like a library.
Marcus!
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Schneider?
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
You said go between them!
No. You like the way I do things.
What do you know about this place?
This one. I think he's in here.
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Through the library?
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
Well, uh...
How did you she was a Nazi?
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
Head for the fireplace!
What?
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
Nice landing.
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
Why are you trying to kill us?
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
That was a misunderstanding.
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Indy, look!
Come one, what's wrong?
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
India...
It's pulling me deeper!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Oh really?
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
He's afraid of something.
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
What is it...?
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
I want to go home...
Yes.
No... they won't kill me.
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
...I need to make a phone call.
Do me a favor, Al.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
I am. You are.
Door's locked.
Who did?
That's not a good idea.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Just scratched my arm, why?
What do we do?
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
The beach.
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
I don't want to eat it.
Why not?
It's sand.
What?
...Joe.
What did that cost?
Which one?
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
It's not your time. I get time off.
No. What will you do.
Bingo.
I can't see a thing.
Well...?
He hung us up dry.
Do it.
What exactly?
Keep thinking.
About what?
She works for them.
Now, you're too suspicious.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
Not that truth!
What kind of a deal?
They have stolen state property.
Who's our little man?
What Job?
Yes?
When you do...
Who...are you?
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Then who did?
The poet...something he said...
Dinner...tonight.
Wait. What's your name?
I am sort of scattered.
Who do you work for?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
They left. I had to go with them.
Why did you stay with me?
What did you tell them?
Why did they leave?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I'm just on vacation.
He must be a good friend.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Get us one.
Are you alright?
Now what?
Now what?
Just like that?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Is there anything else?
Wait.
Just one. The back up.
Right there.
It'l be alright.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
So we better get started.
What's new?
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Mom.
Yes, baby?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
P.J.'s.
Push it.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Yeah, I heard rumors.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Debbie...
What about you, you got a crew already?
Okay. 
No, no, we're fine...
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
You ready...?
Is there any more rice...?
I don't understand.
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Yeah.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Area code 212-555-0199.
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
We're there.
Yeah.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Oh, please, Mike...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
You greased the rails!
You try and have a good time.
He doesn't seem to be listening...
Well, what do you really think, though?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
There is -- there is no family.
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
Seven...
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
We rest, Your Honor.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
Why in God's name would I want...?
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
Why do you think she did it?
I assume this is on Rex?
Why would you be here?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
He wants a reconciliation.
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Hmmm...
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Miles? You're scaring me.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
We are. And it's winding down.
Do you need a Tagamet?
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
Maybe.
Every week --
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
She always looked out for me.
Nothing.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
Never mindI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
Please don't shout.
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
If you really mean it, I will.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Any others?
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
Beat it! 
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
You weren't so bad yourself.
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
It takes money to buy food.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
You're crazy.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
That's silly.
This looks like the best spot.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
Sure.
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
What are you thinking about?
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Amazing.
You might give me a little credit.
Come onget in.
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
You're forgetting you're married.
sixseveneightnine
Husband?
Yesif he is your husband.
Isn't he here?
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
What time is it?
What's 'at?
What's up?
Yeah? Where?
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Wait a minute, GordonI
Don't "Joe" me.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
Yeah.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Who?
Yeahwouldn't it?
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Orange, New Jersey.
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
There were no phone records.
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Yeah, I guess you do.
What do you think, Lou?
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Did he pay you for this?
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
But why?
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
Yeah.
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
I see.  And where did you drive?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
And Shaw?
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Four to six.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
No.  Never heard of him.
Who?
Nonsense.  What next?
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Hi.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Post Office.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
The Warren Commission call him?
Are they?  Why would they?
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
It never did. 
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
And he never hit you before?
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
That sounds fun.
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Who was there for your ass?
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Three years.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
She sound scared?
Can I have a word with you?
What's this?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
No, you didn't. What branch?
It was the other guy who busted me.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
You get a chance to use it?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
You're not old. You look great.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
How old's Annette?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
You don't actually do it that way?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
Has he hinted around?
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
That's my job.
Which one?
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
Ray wants him.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
What do you tell Nicolet?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
Oh, Miss Brown?
What the fuck is that shit?
What for?
Who's the other one?
What's her story?
Yes. All those things are true.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
What did you do after that?
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
I thought you were watching him.
Buy ya a beer?
Sure.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
Beaumont Livingston?
You already knew that?
What do you think it is?
What the hell you doin'?
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
I just came here to talk.
Yeah?
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
They already know it's you.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
If you want.
Can you cover that?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Man, I don't like that part.
What does she think she's gettin?
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Four days ago.
Which one?
Detroit.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Is it dead?
He went to meet that stewardess.
Then what?
I'm going to wait in the car.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
You're outside?
Uh-huh.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
An employee I had to let go.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
That's Winston. He works here.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Hey, Max.
Yes.
I got some more business for ya.
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
In a way, yes.
My office.
Call her, tell her the combination.
It's the next street.
I know where it is.
Yeah.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
Let me out of here!
I see.
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
Daddy!
What do you want from me?
It's short, huh?
Oh, terrific.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
But the paper ...
Who?
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
What?
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Hell, you think I am?
Carlson? Is he new here?
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
I'm not cold.
Go to sleep.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Jake, is that you?
Gee, thanks a lot.
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Did you look around the headboard?
I don't let anybody call me that.
I must have been out of my head.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
What?
Not to me.
Is that the one who died?
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
You okay?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Am I home?
I love you, Jez.
Why didn't you call me?
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
I can waitress. I'm good.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Sit down, Jake.
Where have they gone?
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
I don't know what to say.
Where's Wong?
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
We're doing everything we can.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
The army?
I don't have all day, kid.
It's locked!
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Okay that hurt.
Nice touch.
Kay-Em!
We'd need charges.
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Get them in the lab!
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Where is he?
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
That's why I'm here.
She needs a little time.
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Yuck.
Now that's just gross.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Later.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
It's just you and me, then.
Almost done.
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Kay-Em we made it!
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
What?!!
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Guys, he's right behind us!
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
Where...?
That's it! Radio in for help!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
Probably out in the back yard.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Can you stand something to eat?
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
I don't know if I can do that without a...
I was acting in the town's best interests...
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
...Nothing.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
Just keep kicking.
You from around here?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
We're not even sure what it was.
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Would you like something? Some coffee?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
I'm not hungry, oddly.
So that's cool with you, then?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
You're being really immature.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
I don't really know anything about it.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
What? My eyes are not lying!
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Oh.
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
Junk?
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Is Vanessa here?
No.
No?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
But you're old!
I heard that was you.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
You sound shocked or something.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
What?
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
What would be a good time for you?
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
Brian.
This the book your writing?
What happened to Adele?
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
...I do.
A book on the warehouse murders?
I still think we should have met them first.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
What is it?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Shit.
What do you think?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Yeah.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
That.
Yeah. Why you give money.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Shut up.
How much you gonna take?
About ten. Fifteen is good.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
You goin'?
Sup then? Sup?
Yeah. Come on.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
How do you know?
What is it?
Why?
One.
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Thanks.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
You are being ripped open.
Do you know where he went?
And you don't get shit out of it.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yep.
You think so?
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
It's me. Telly.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Casual.
No.
You're a lying bastard!
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
Why does he call Sanderson?
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
Hello, Peter.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
How?
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
I know where you are.
You don't understand.
What's this?
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
What scars?
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
I just can't believe it.
What is it, dad?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
For what?
Six, eight hours tops.
Anything?
What about prints?
Yeah.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
I'm busy right now.
We're going to work on the message.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
What are they, please?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
I know it was bad.
No.
What?
Nothing.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
It's over now.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
We're almost married.
Have they harmed you?
Lyssa ...
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
They know when they're going to die?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
I'm not sure.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
The spiral begins in the west.
She can see the Beast!
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
You're coming with us.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
I'm not hungry.
We must try to get horses.
Hand over your dinner.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
Go, join them.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
Look at its insides.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He will come for me.
Yes. We lost five.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Yes.
Each to his fate, lad.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
It will not help.
I cannot stop the sand.
No.
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
...What?
Do you need money?
OK, I'm fine.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
What, for example?
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
When I say I love you.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
What shall we do?
Where are you going?
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
How are you, Miss?
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Why am I such an authority?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
What steps do we take now?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Ellen?
What it is -- is the truth.
I do love you... very, very much.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
That's okay -- really it is.
Maurice?
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
You tell stories?
That's me.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Umm, no.  It's just that --
What happened?
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
When are you leaving?
Come on Mr. Parker.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Don't do this.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
... My father.
Evening News?
I've always wanted a watch like that.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Orange soda?
Are you working?
Sarah -- with an H?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Are you serious.
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Hi!
I'm going to fill it right now.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Thank you, Sera.
I like it here with you.
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
Why would I kill my husband?
I loved him!
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
I'll take that as a no.
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Because they got wet.
You're not going up there.
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
What's going on?
What?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
That's terrible!
How'd it go at the trial?
Name?
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
But maybe it's not what you think.
So?
Okay, how would it work?
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Up for a celebration dinner?
Is he the only one?
How could this happen?
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
I got bangs!
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
It's pink.
Your what?
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
East coast people are different.
No, silly. I go here.
You got into Harvard Law?
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Thank you. Having fun?
In court. On opposing sides.
What do you want with me?
But I'm hideous!
Like some vile toadstool.
Why have you brought me here?
No more... please...
Yes?
I see...
You're a beast!
Might we watch, too?
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
There must be an answer somewhere.
The princess is dead.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
By the grace of God.
Pregnant, is she?
Track the demon to his lair.
We must follow that bird.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
God's blessing.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
We'll find it.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
There isn't much time!
What magic have we on our side?
One more turn...
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Sunlight, you say?
Mean you to seek him out below?
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
How're these?
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
A promise is a sacred oath.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
I'm afraid it may storm.
Tis not fit for a princess.
I have no wife.
What have I done?
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
And charmed, of course.
How so?
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Hello, Jack.
How came you by this blade?
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Simple as that, eh?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
He seems lonely.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
I'm living here while I build another house.
My keys.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Where to?
I don't know.
Where's your dad?
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Really?
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Where are you?!
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
I hate to ask about a window.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
That would take weeks.
How's your wife?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
Thanks for the shower.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
Is Alyssa here?
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
I did warn you.
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I warned you yesterday.
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
I'm not doing it!
You're too fucking late.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
I wish you had told me then.
Sun glasses?
She seemed upset.
I still don't know what that means.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
Good for you.
Ah!  Oh....
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Where have you been for a week?!
But you can't call me while you think?
I need to talk to you.
Money?
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
Where will you live?
The garage.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
I don't have a phone.
I did say he could go.
What is it?
You brought your kids?
I need to know.
What did he say?
You got any weed?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
After the kids are back in school.
I can't go right now.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
I was talking about our marriage.
What are you doing home?
Hey.
Can you stay for dinner?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Yeah.
I'm talking about a haircut.
These are free papers.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Is Spanky here?
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
She's alright, isn't she?
Married?
Yes, boss.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
Yes, sir.
Sure, boss.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
I know it begins with a "C"...
Nothing.
Reward?
Guess we better get going, huh?
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
You know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
What's up, Ray?
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
No.
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
Don't mention it.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Crawfords.
That was five years ago.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
1932? That's like, that's like...
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
What's going on here?
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
What's your name?
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Now will you get in the flask?
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
And he's dead serious.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Hello, Cassius.
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
How did you see me?
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Where is he? He's late.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Knock, knock.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
What was it called, sir.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
That's a big pass, Elton John.
You sure you're down with this?
Good idea... kill me.
Dude. Seriously?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
Why are you laughing?
If you want to.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
What were you thinking coming here?
Why would you be floating?
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
..."The Devil?"...
Yes. What is rent?
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Where do you send them?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
That was a great shot you made.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
I'm very smart.
Well then...?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
You felt sad. What's your name?
Later.
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
Uh-uh.
I have.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Are you taking me to them?
He's good, isn't he?
They won't believe us.
I doubt it.
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
Hello, Sandman.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
But there may be a few around somewhere.
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
Well? How do you like it?
I don't think so.
Good... You up for a drive?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Listen.
Pete... You okay?
No.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
His or ours?
Have you partied with him?
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
You liked it.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Yes.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
The police called us.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
I won't ever tailgate.
My... My head.
What's bothering you, Madison?
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
I like to laugh, Fred.
What's that?
Good book, huh?
We will.
I told you to stay in the car!
I thought there might be somebody inside.
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Okay.
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
I don't know.
I was?
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Oh, read it!
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Fossils.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south
He might have lost his way.
Where are they? Do you see them?
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
I'm thinking.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
Just call me Barney.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Come on, Lovey.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Huh?
Where is your mad pilot?
So there are others?
That's intelligent.
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Very often.
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Why, no.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
Are you the High Lama?
What is it, my son?
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
What are you talking about?
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
So you think I'm mad?
I don't need any proof.
Is that all my story meant to you?
Oh, George . . .
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Yes.
Yes, everything!
Was this your idea?
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Perhaps.
All right, I'll be there.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Well this didn't.
You do?
Kay, I'm sorry...
I wasn't scared...
Sir, you can't just--
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
You don't know the half of it.
Why?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Something's wrong here.
He's here to help!?
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
After I got the shit beat out of me!
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
What do we do?
No.
You figured what?
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
Is it now?
What?
Can you see the balloon man?
Drop some money.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Don't worry, Lamar.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
And who the hell is that?
Seventeen minutes.
No maglev system.
Yeah?  So?
Go ahead.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
But you call this room the "temple".
Flaws.
She spoke to me.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
Come on!
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
I wanted to.
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
But you have to.  They said you would.
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Something wrong?
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
Heal who?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
The system would collapse.
If... you have one.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Oh, God, what did you do?
This is all my fault.
I understand.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
Lamar, I found something.
I don't understand --
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
There's thousands of units like this one.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
What about your meeting?
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
So you haven't seen his apartment?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
Nice to meet you, Wally.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
So?
What, sir?
Is it the good room?
All the suites are about the same.
Where's the place to go tonight?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
It's on West Broadway.
Bullshit.
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
No.
No. What kind of bachelor party?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
I'll support you.
Max offered to stake me.
Goodbye, Bobby.
Yeah, sure.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
That it?
This is it.
You like the ponies?
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Then what are you saying?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
Ruiz knows about this?
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
What is it?
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
Take a few days --
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
It's important.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Sorry, man, but...
Any time, bro.
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
Ask if he said anything to her.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
C'mon, man...
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
Where do you think you're going?
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Put that shit out...
All the more reason.
Wanna bet?
Why?
You're out of money?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
Calm down.
So what do we do?
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
You want your surprise?
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
The line's over there.
Don't drag my ass into this --
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Ow, shit...
Come, now. You just got here.
The Soho Grand?
You're from LA, right?
So whenever we want...
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
No. What is it?
Yes, sir.
No...
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
Dip?
What they call you?
I'm working trains. Selling.
Is your papa West Indian?
Why?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
That's what it is. Walk on out.
What you say?
Man, what do you want?
Putting all that poison in your hair.
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Little.
Then the devil is white.
The body is a holy repository.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Tell Him that.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
Is the program ready?
What points?
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
Yes.
Just hold me.
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Brother Earl.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Let's cancel.
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
Sure, man.
What?
Is she hooking?
I ain't stupid.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Did you hear me?!
No. You'll be marked for death.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
Fine as May wine.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
I'm the man.
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Watch your tongue, boy.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
A lot of people are looking for you.
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[What do you mean?]
[Don't lie to me!]
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
So how's business?
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
If they like me.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Time will tell.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
I don't understand.
Could I stop you?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Then be trained.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
No.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Jordan!
Planned what?
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Last night. Do you know something?
Good news. You're going back to school.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
She likes him.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
That's what friends do.
What was she to Creasy then?
Hey, Herbie...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Where?
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
What for?
Who you gonna call?
Waddaya getting so sore about?
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
You told me.
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Marty.
Were the lights on?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Yes, I know.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
No, Marty, please...
No...
What?
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Sure, what?
What?
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
What didn't you like about her?
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
What nurses?
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
Wadda you so sore about?
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
Home.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
You really think we hurt him that bad?
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Never heard of him.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
You betcher ass, Dad.
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Is he out?
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
All of them?
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
The bastards outconned us.
See you.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Same here.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
You're leaving tomorrow?
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Just in dreams?
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
First decent idea you've had in a month.
You mean who hit who?
Yes, sir?
Sir?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Yeah?
Nice.
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Who?
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Hello, John.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going
John Doe Clubs? What for?
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
How much money do you get?
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
All set, Ann?
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
What letter?
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Oh.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Has he been here?
No.
What do you do when you work?
Baseball?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Boss.
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
No!
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
How?
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
What's your name?
That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .
She isn't?
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Is there a crowd in the street?
No, sir.
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
They're not usually graduate students.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
What's the line?
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
Could I please have a little water?
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Where's the car?
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
I what?
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Yep.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
How do you feel after a shooting.
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
You tell me.
You know why I like the track?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
The jockey!
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
You're crazy.
And what about the ones you don't save?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Greg.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
You think I didn't need you?
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Stay here, don't move.
Scottie?
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
Repoed this morning.
This is Halden.
Who are you?!
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Dream?!
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
You sure he's going to come?
What's her name?
He had keys.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
Who did he digitize?
I've got to get back.
No.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
You said we were on the same programming team.
Why?
What?
Not you.  A copy.
I'm sorry.
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Program name?
Access established.
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
So how can we get to it?
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
You okay?
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
There goes the neighborhood.
And how do we release the power?
GET OFF ME!
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
What!
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
And I ain't no nigger either!
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
You ain't even a man yet.
The deal's too good, Frankie
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
Luciano.
Meyer.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
How soon can we pull this off?
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
He's trying to make it.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
You gotta plan these things.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
We were overdue to get hit.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Luciano is dead?
You're fuckin' crazy.
Switch hands.
Monkeybone?
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Stu Miley.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
Why?
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Land of Death. How do I get there?
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
What are you watching?
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Stu...LOOK!
I just need to use the phone, lady.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
You mean it's dangerous?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Where's the Majority Leader?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
But it *isn't*?
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Huh?
What! Who?
You know--little worms--ambition.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Do we *have* to?
Susan? Nah!
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Otis!
Are you ready for him, Bill?
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Yes. Come in.
A pet shop?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Please, sir!--come with me!
No, Jeff--please--!
Oh, now--
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Hello, Jefferson.
Certainly would, Joseph.
Just fine.
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
What?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
Go right ahead.
Why?
No!
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
Great.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Hello.
Well! You don't say!
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
No?
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
What do you mean?
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Jim!
Father--oh.
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Senator Paine will state it!
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Deeds?
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Yes.
Were you present when all these things took place?
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Huh?
There's Times Square.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
What did you mean by that?
I've often thought about going back.
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
No. It's nothing.
Huh?
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have
When're you going to see him again?
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Come on, come on!
I wanna see that guy!
It's a lie!
Hang up.
You can't?
Yes?
Yes.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
What for?
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
No?
Yes. That is to say
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Let him alone.
No, I mean - about my client.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Brookfield just came in.
You mean  by the neck or something?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Yes, sir.
You're Walter, aren't you?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Prairie? Oysters?
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Please!
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
Dr. Mumford.
What's that?
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
I'm fine.
What are you doing for lunch?
Interesting approach. What was his name?
What kind of doubts?
What's that?
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
What's that?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
A little.
What do you think's wrong with her?
Yes, your honor.
Oh?
My patient had to leave early.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
Why do you watch?
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
Sure I can, Lionel.
Hello, Lionel.
Is she a friend of yours?
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Ph.D., psychologist.
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
No.
Hmm.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
I'm not making any promises.
Something's bothering her.
Please... forgive me.
Sorry... I'm done.
Sore throat?
Where?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
And he's where?
You like it?
Which thing?
Is something wrong, Sofie?
You're upset.
I don't follow you.
I think so.
Transference!
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
Is that the question?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Damn! What is your name?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Sounds like you have several.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
Things got a lot worse.
And the drugs?
That'd be Lily.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
I guess that makes sense.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And then killing your sister.
My very good friend! What a surprise.
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Why do you like to fight so much?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
You know your history.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
That "thing" gets me excited.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
I'm not?
No... Why?... Should I?
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
You did not!?... We're not!?
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
What?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Where are you going?
So who killed him?
He was the last time I saw him.
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Me, too.
Yes!
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
Come here.
What?
Sure.
What's your real name?
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
Bye. 
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
What are you talking about?
I'm liking this.
There's just not enough of us.
There's a big difference.
So what else has Superman got?
Maybe there was traffic.
Roy --
You did?
Hi.
This is bad.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
That was too close.
Oh no.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
I'm glad you like it.
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Cavalry?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
General Bonaparte?
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
No, sir.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
No... nothing at all.
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
Were you in love with him?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Open the door.  It's me.
What are you doing in there?
Five minutes.
Separate bedrooms?
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
Why not?
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
You wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
I know.
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Do you like music?
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Yes, sir.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Me neither.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Nobody!
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
Just a little.
What you mean, so?
Thanks a lot, Craig.
Most definitely.
All damn.
Craig, remember what I told you.
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
What was that?
Call me.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Tape his mouth shut.
Rancho Cucamonga?
Just do it.
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
My back.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
Can we go now?
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
I killed you.
But...
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
You got anything smaller?
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
Oh, Jesus ...
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Hi.
What are you going to do!?
You stole that.
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
That one.
And what happens if I don't call you?
Yeah.
Any trouble?
I'll bet.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
She went.
AAA-MENN!
You have all sinned!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About what!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
Amen.
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
She's gone to Moundsville.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
John, where's your folks?
I'll see to Pearl.
Nothin'!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
What's that you're playing with, boy?
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Don't you believe me?
What's your name?
O no! Your turn!
Can I have milk too?
No.
Can I have this?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
I was praying.
My flesh and blood!
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
This man down at the Drugstore...
Now who was this?
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Guess I did.
Yeah.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
What!?
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
What's the Coroner got to say?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Krueger.
Get into bed.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
You okay?
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
Someone else was there.
He's nuts about you.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
You should be more careful, Anna.
I have nothing to hide.
What was it like?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
Or it might be the firing squad!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
Yes, Comrade?
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
The Duchess...
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Your breakfast, monsieur.
What time have you, Gaston?
Have you?
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
How much does this cost?
A day.
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
What's new?
What's that?
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
...and Kopalski.
You, please.
Me?
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
You repeat yourself.
Do you hear that?
Thank you.
The telephone is ringing.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Because we are an odd couple.
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Do you like Scotch stories?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
I don't think so.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
A funny story?
All right, we'll make it red.
No! No!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Let's turn on the radio.
No music.
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
They belong to the people.
Yes, sweetheart. 
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Those newspaper people?
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
No.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Thank you.
Yes, Swana.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Now, please, Swana.
Madame, if you...
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
Where are they?
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Good morning, Comrade.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
So ... let's go ...
What?
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
It's a code or something.
I figured that out.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
This is not a joke, John!
No, sir.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
No, sir, you did not.
I don't have a pistol.
So?
Sir?
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
Because they're not Americans.
What about the documents he promised?
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
My friends call me "Mister President."
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
No.
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
I never met the man.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
We took his system out.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
Who do you think is behind it?
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
I always get my man.
You're fucking me.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Where you from?
Hi.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
Are you serious?
I don't want them to love me.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
It'll be over soon.
Won or lost?
In Angola. Yeah.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
Nineteen zero and nine.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
Uh-huh.
He won't neither. He never has.
Yes ma'am?
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
I never do.
It ain't even three years we been married.
I got it Mama.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
Big talk.
Goin' where?
Odessa.
So... for how long do we have to...
Yes I do.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
You know what's goin' on?
I know where the money is.
And where is that.
Yessir?
Yes I did.
How'd you find it?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Airport.
Who is this.
What way would that be?
Didn't mean nothin'.
...Will there be somethin' else?
What time do you close?
Sir?
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
You married into it.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Yes.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
One room, one night.
Good. I need everything else.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
I'm sorry.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
So was I.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
The heroin. You don't have it.
Are you jackin' with me?
No sir.
Nam?
Could I have that in American?
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Oww! My arm, careful!
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
Anyway, so what?
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
I know that...
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Umm... yes. Back home.
Oh, Betty --
What?
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
The one you were telling me about?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
No...
I... I don't know...
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I hope you're right...
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
Worse... you're in Texas.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
Wesley...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
Very graceful. Perfect form.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
What'd you get her?
Jesus Christ!
He's waiting...
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
Can I have an evil twin?
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
What the hell's going on?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
No... before that.
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
What did you say?
Waitaminute -
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
...Pete?
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Whuhh...
Pete have a brother?
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
In any state.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
That's not my ring.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
An' all my meals for free...
It was a moment a weakness!
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
I am. Hur you?
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Thank you, sir!
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
You... in the Navy?
Why?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
I wrote. Not every week...
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
No, sir.
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Vietnam?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
Lynette, where's Sid?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Do you go to school?
He didn't give you much choice.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
I'll get it if you want.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
Sid, what happened?
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
What the fuck is funny about this?
God.
There is not one thing funny here.
I can't just...
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
The walls are steel, right?
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
This was your department, Junior.
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
And we're never getting in.
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
Cut it back a little bit.
We're leaving.
Something's weird.
Makes me nervous.
The furniture guy?
That room!
What do they want?
I heard you.
Yeah.
What, what, what is it?!
Morse code?
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
What are you doing?
Call Dad!
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
I was trying not to tell you...
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Tyrone...
Lemme see that rifle son...
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
Like?
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
...Glad you came man.
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
Jesus...
I don't think that will be any problem...
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
We need money first...
So what's the deal?
I don't know.
I'm down.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
What are you saying?
Motherfuckers...
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Am I one of that sort?
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
You look well, Charlotte.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Very well, proceed, sir.
Thank you.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
I consider them linked.
Very well, let us move on to...
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
No...
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
He left us.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
One of yours?
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
Long time.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
How far away?
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
I'm not tired!
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
What?
I can hardly read these.
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
It's funny, all right.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Doesn't look like they last long.
But--
What did we do, Jud?
Wouldn't wash?
Why, then, things should be fine.
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
Shit! Look at this mess!
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
The situation has changed.
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
You've got sand, for a maid.
Do you not know what this is, then?
Did he speak?
I can't breathe.
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
Come on!
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Dead serious.
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
Move away.
Why ask me?
Is that so?
I swear, you look just like him.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Shut up, before you lose them all!
What's that?
On what?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
You've seen it?
No.  She hasn't.
A moment.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
What did you use?
... plastic.
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
You don't want this.
Yeah, I do!
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
Sir, please try to hold still.
Susan!
Same old Daniel.
Nothing really worthwhile.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
Mouse?  What mouse?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
Just look at it!
You saved my life.
Susie... I...
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
That's considerate of you.
Just listen to this  Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely!
Where did you get those letters?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
No? What do you look upon her as?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
Is that so?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
I'm not quitting!
You're my what?
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Sure - I think so, Stew.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
To Old Madrid.
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Stop calling me Mother!
And you struck him right here in our house?
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Me, sir?
No, sir!
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
I just putter.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
It doesn't matter.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
But I really should get home.
How was your day?
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
It goes away ... It'll go away.
Where are you gonna go?
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Really Biff? The keenest?
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
It is?
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
What?
She won't go out with me?
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
Are you alright?  What is it?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Well, I never had to do it before.
And where's that?
Hello Mr. Simpson.
What color is that hedge of yours?
What are you doing?
Get lost!
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
JENNIFER!
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
I had nothing to do with that fire.
Not directly anyhow ...
The pages filled in?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Oh ... Hi.
Sure ... Where would we go?
What's going on?
You're gonna forget about me.
McIntire's.
How much does it cost?
I can't.
Excuse me?
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
I didn't do anything wrong.
EXCUSE ME?
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
Do you have the lettuce?
Yes.
Oh hi!
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Why?
You know what I really like?
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Yeah.
Yeah. TV busted?
Oh GOD ...
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
...yes I'm still on hold...
This is "Fly With Us?"
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
It's fine, but --
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
I....please don't do this.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Hi, is this Jack?
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Can I ask you a question?
Uh-huh.
-- you said you did.
This is not cool.
No.
Do you know them.
Yeah.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
Who is it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No I didn't say that.
What did he want?
...yes I did...?
Hi.
I'll see you later.
I don't freak out very often.
Hello?
Lena?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
For what?
For work.....
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
For what?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
What do you mean?
What?
That's that.
I didn't know you had a sister?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
What is this?
Good morning, Barry....
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
You should go on a trip.
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Ok.
Where you been?
I need to talk to you for a second.
What are you doing?
That's it.
What's the problem?
We should be going --
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
You ready?
Just tell him to call me.
No.
I'm sorry. You're right.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Free his mouth.
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
And --?
There I was taxed; it's true.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I saw the longing in your eye --
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
Yes?
I'll be waiting.
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
There's something else I want from you.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
Ever met Walter Winchell?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Why is that, Louis?
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
It's not really--
This picture--
There's nothing to explain
I will not defend my life to you--
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You needn't use that language with me
You will not walk out on me
I just want to understand--
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
Magic
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
Oh for Christ's sake-
Let me out.
I don't have it anymore?!
The title?
I want you back
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I'm sorry.
What does this have to do with--?
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
May I help you?
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
CITIZEN KANE
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Jesus
Then find another theater
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
Believe what you want.
And where you goin'?
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Yeah, she's nice.
With her? How?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
You want us to wait for you?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
How's that?
When?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
What?
Whatsa matter with you?
Three more, I figure.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
Can you see it?
Jake...
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
You're not interested in him?
What?
I never noticed his face.
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
And you're drinking with them right now.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
His wife took a trip.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Like what?
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Who are you?
Lisa Fremont.
She expects me to marry her.
That's abnormal.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Isn't he a salesman?
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
What about this morning? Any developments?
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
Huh?
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
What?
Got a shovel?
Smart girl.
What do you need money for?
How much do you think you'll need?
You haven't even heard from him?
It is something really important, Jeff?
How's your leg?
Not too active.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
You mean "goodnight."
I have one now.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
I have the whole weekend off.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
What for?
What?
Sure.  It's fine.
Yeah.
What's he going to pull--
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
We don't have time.
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Will you let him tell it!
Will you wait a minute?
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
He's just loaded, honey.
He's home.  I heard the car.
Yes, sir.
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
Hi there.
Boy!
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
I'm here.  Shut up.
Man, you're schizoid!
Isn't he schizoid?
I'm here.
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Get lost.
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Okay--
You going there?
No--I was just--maybe--
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
You smell like baby powder.
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
What's he like?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Judy--we're ready for you now.
That one?
I'll never get close to anybody.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Gabriel, you promised!
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
What.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Ashley, Jesus --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
Nick, no --
You sold him out.
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
That guy knows you?
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
You... you don't know me --
But you were saying you were...
So you could get with my sister.
What's her middle name?
What college.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Hey, it's... been two years --
I did.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Why not.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
At least gimme video poker.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
...never... tried...
What about the Powwow Safe?
What?
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
Cancer-sucker.
That motherfucker --
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
What the hell was that about --
Hell you haven't.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Yeah.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
She's using a new perfume.
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
NO!!!
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
And you set me up.
Do what?
That was my king!
What? No...
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
I'll call somebody.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
Who, Mr. White?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
I'm sorry.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Why?
You didn't ask.
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Gun shot.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
What's wrong with it?
No real people?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
If we don't, he'll die.
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Who shot who?
Anybody hurt?
You can't leave us here.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
You can stay here if you like.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
Hold on.
I suppose it is.
All right -- it's said!
So did I. They were in it.
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
I've got eleven horses.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Finished, son?
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
Half of them are mine.
You're not bein' quite fair.
Don't act so -- crazy.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
What is it?
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
You're not giving up?
Aren't we stayin'?
And that's tough, isn't it?
What do they look like?
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
No, I won't let you do it.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Thanks.
Cindy, what's going on?
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Cindy, let me...
How about these buns?
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Yo! That jacket is tight.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
What?
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
Alright... I might need your help.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Yes.
Because she will lie?
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Ray!"
BLOOD FEAST!
You said you hated him.
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
But Mom, the video's not over.
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
Chip, your ride is here.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
I love that you're my wife.
You bring me such peace...
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
"P" as in...
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
Hello.
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
I certainly was not!
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
He's a good boy.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse   -- used a phony health inspector's badge  they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
I'd like to get out of here.
You could go and open the door.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
"The Dante?"
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
She's a pretty good sort.
Nothing.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
I'd like that.
Yes.
But I'm not joking.
What's that?
Please, Jacqueline.
Good-bye.
I can imagine.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
If it is true  there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
What's wrong, Mary?
But why come to me?
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
Would they hurt her?
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
One believes - it's like any other religion...
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
I'm very, very serious.
I didn't know.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
That makes it all the more difficult 
Television?
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Nothing I can't finish later.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Like what?
She said it on her tape.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
What do you have to do to get ready?
Yes, I have. I will.
About me?
On tape?
Can't.
You said you weren't always impotent.
That's correct.
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
No.
Like maybe a big part?
Possibly.
Don't do that.
Why not?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Why don't I believe you?
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
Why?
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
Goddam right.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
No, I didn't.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Yeah, I know.
I take it you've never masturbated?
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
No, he left last week.
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Let me talk to him first.
And what?
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Fine.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Because I never got around to it.
Well, why?
He just asked me questions.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
He wouldn't do that.
No, I touched me.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Nope.
About what?
That's all.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
Were you disappointed?
No? Not even one more?
I would.
Maybe.
Hello.
I want to see you.
Do you want me to stop calling?
Right.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
Mr. Millaney?
Yeah.
He said immediately.
Medical clinic?
OK. But late.
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
You say something?
Yes? Who is there?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
Yes?
No? How come?
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
When do I get to see Brad?
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
I don't want to get up there.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
He was adopted you know.
I'd forgotten.
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
You're practically naked!
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
YOUNG BLOOD
YOUNG BLOOD
Me?
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Flavors!
Isn't she lovely?
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
So what's up?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
What are you pouring tonight?
What do you think?
You okay, Miles?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Two years ago, buddy.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Hiya.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Just tell me.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
How would you rate this one?
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
I will.  See ya!
Hey, there you are.
Understanding of what?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
Is it the money thing?
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
I said okay?
Do you like them?
What's that supposed to mean?
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
No way. No way.
Want me to drive?
What the fuck!
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
What was the bottle that did it?
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah, weird. But great.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Yeah. Thanks.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Hello?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
I told you I need a drink.
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
That was fun last night.
Oops. Sorry.
You golf?
See you, Miles. You take care.
Stephanie! Stop!
Houdini's sick.
Does she ever answer back?
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
My ballet recital.
I'm scared.
I don't feel much.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
...I will.
It was very dark.
That roof is over ten feet high.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
Yes.
What time is it?
Should we turn off the lights?
This is going to do nothing.
We won't be able to get out of there.
They're broadcasting...
No.
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Bimboo?
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
It's the strangest thing Father.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.  So he was tall?
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
And three weeks.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
I didn't know you were out.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
...Gotta go...
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
Where's Jake?
More than enough.
I just came out to say goodbye.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
Are you all right?
I already did that.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Offend anybody lately?
No, Leavenworth.
South of here, past Chimayo.
They got a saloon there?
No hard feelings.
You haven't got any money.
Yeah?
What happened?
You own this land.
Why?
Get out of here, Jake.
New record.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
It's none of your business.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
What brings you into my saloon?
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
Nifty.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Why'd you go into business with him?
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- What's wrong with that?
The public decides who's on that list.
Please.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
I'll send you her resume.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Well, I --
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
What?... What did you say?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
You never were together, Hal.
You can't.
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
-- Please, get away from me.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
I've seen them all before.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
You saw that?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
Not quite how I imagined it --
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
The background is.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
--My God.
Why, Malcolm?
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
I'm going to see you again, right?
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Words.
I didn't know you were funny.
How often do you see them?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
Can I ask you then?
When?
Something happened, didn't it?
Yes, I am.
What?
They're right here.
Lots of things.
You can see her?
They scare me too sometimes.
Cole, please stop.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Alright!
Nope.
Bitch.
Aha. The Lovers.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Carl, what are you doing?
Gene.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
I could. You sucked.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
"Peggy-Sue" --
You're out of your mind, man.
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
This is his room... isn't it?
People say he was a murderer.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
What's wrong?
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Who? Us?!
You got something against farm people, Keith?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
How does it feel, Keith?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Second verse!
-- Where have you two been?
Sorry.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
Starla, it ain't --
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
It's my nature.
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
He's a fucking Martian?!
What the hell are we going to do?!
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Looks like a chipmunk.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
I never danced in a towel before.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Where'd he go?
You.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
You got my barley pop?
Kate McConnell.
Who'd want to?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
An existentialist.
A what?
Well?...
Seriously?!?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
Hey...
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
You could've asked.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
Why are you stopping?
What can I say?
See ya, Bandit.
I'll do it.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Let's get the hell outta here.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
Just fine. What's the weather like?
You're coming up to the scale house.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
Breaker. Breaker.
Go head on, breaker.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Man, that's great.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
Yeah, we've been through that.
D'you talk to'm?
I said I got his machine.
Without peer?
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
Got hit twice.
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
Bulllllshit...
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
That's fantastic.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
How much sleep?
Shut up.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
What do you want?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
I'll go with you.
Don't.
You're better when you take them.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
What happened to us, exactly?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
Sartorius.
Neither did I.
You never said you wanted one.
I never said I didn't.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
How can you be here...
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Snow, get up here, now.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Uh...
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
Beg pardon?
Didn't do very well, did you?
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
What's to like?
What do you want?
Oh God, that's great!
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
How long you going away for?
So.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Not if you don't want me to.
Your what...?
Get in bed.
She's got to identify him.
Why?
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
I just sat and listened.
What about when she identifies him?!
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Are you in charge here?
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
You should'a brought the girl.
How do you know where the gun is?
Lay back, Mack.
How about dinner tonight?
She's taking singing lessons.
Shooting.
Shooting?
Sexual tension...
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Nonot really.
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Flash, drop it--
Lizzy!
Lemme down, bugface!
How are you doing, kid?
Yeah--
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
Good morning, Liz.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
Oh, don't do it on my account--
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
The record--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Where'd you get the clown suit?
So they're airing this tonight?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
They never caught on.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Jawohl.
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
That's right.
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
My legs are frozen.
What some brandy?
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
What is this? This is water?
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
You did?
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
You want to go?
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
Says who?
Lay off, Sefton.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
We did it.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Target their Bridge.
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
That's where he's going.
I get it. I get it.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Can you locate them?
We're within range, sir.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Better?
Aye.
Kirk here.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
No.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Understood. That will be all.
Captain, are you all right?
Doctor Soran?
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
The royal...studs?
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Tractor beam, aye!
Nothing. As before.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Aye sir, coding now.
Why don't we beam it up?
David, I don't understand...
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
Same sector. Metallic mass.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
What is it?
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Logic indicates that is the case.
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
This planet is aging in surges.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
What happened...?
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
Yes. And I know you.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
About a dozen officers and men.
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
I -- saw no future --
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
... He spoke of your friendship.
... Or the one.
Bones!...
What about Spock?
How can you tell that?
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
And who am I hiding from?
Shore leave, Admiral.
Khan could be down there!
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Carol!
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
David --
Jim --
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
David. Please.
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
What?
He's on a build up to detonation!
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
They won't --
No!
We'll lose them if they go in there.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Genesis, what's that?
Just barely, sir.
... No response, sir.
Give the word, Admiral.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
That was a little joke.
Reliant's command...
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
We are clear and free to navigate.
He's very human.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
Bones --
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
Oh, joy.
Wake up, man, wake up!
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
That is what I said, Doctor.
Can you isolate the wave?
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
All right. Let's take it from the top.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
Just lucky, I guess.
You're upset about losing the whales.
Where could you take them?
... Who are you?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
I'm all ears.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
... Gone?!
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Explain.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
I cannot tell a lie.
I meant --
What is it?
Uhura!... Where!
Scotty, how long is this bay?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Hello? Computer...?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
Sulu Hikaru.
Why?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
A perfect moment?
... an offlander?
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
I have to go home now.
Can he breathe under water?
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
I'll order Riker to turn around.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
... had regenerated.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
Ask them.
Worf to Picard...
Worf, you must hurry...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Captain...
Scanners are off line!
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
But it's comfortable.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
Not yet.
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
I do not know what you are referring to.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
Dispersive armor is holding.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
I am the Borg.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Yes.
What do you want?
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
What?
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
We?
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
I have to...
Track their weapons fire.
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
We have to stop them from sending that message.
They're bypassing Engineering...
Worf? Is something wrong?
Good luck, Captain.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
Specifically of...?
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
They'll respect him now...
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Just the size of my head -
She's here - somewhere.
Klingon blood.
Aye, sir.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
He's got it.
How did you know...?
Captain, if --
As you were. Lieutenant...?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Captain, our shields -- !
WE volunteered?
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
Close enough to beam down?
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
If you are logical.
I don't want to.
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
You having hearing problems, mister?
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
What exactly does that mean?
Do you know who I am?
Brother. I cannot move.
Indefinitely.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
Not tonight, I have work here.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
How long until we reach the fleet?
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Open a channel.
New Praetor?
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Just lucky, Admiral.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
And the Senate supports you?
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
In time, Jean Luc.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Long ago.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
They will obey, Praetor.
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
What can I do for you folks?
Sure.
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
Where did you stop last?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Contain it and get back to me.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
You're not hearing me.
This is George Fox...
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
What?
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
Minneapolis... good.
What?
Who?
A drink.
It was yellow.
I do not understand.
Sun...
Do you have a baby?
You did? That's funny. So did we.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
I don't understand 'friend.'
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
It's bad.
I will go. But not you.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
What are you saying?
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
I understand.
I will say that we can be friends.
Where do you think you're going?
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
My grandmother's rich.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
I don't know where he is.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
Tell him I'm not here.
No, sir. Radar.
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
Judy, that's stupid.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
I wouldn't think so.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
You think Tran killed her?
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
Naw.  She won't call me.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Jesus.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
Where's Faith?
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
That would be no.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
What is it?
And gives it to you.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
So that gives you something.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
There's a plus side?
You never told me.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
That's the original.  There are no copies.
Take it to him.
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
You have the body?
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
"Was?"
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
I was looking for a pattern.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Miss me, Dave?
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
And one other thing.
What's this country coming to?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
Hello?
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
It's quite advanced.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
Suspect Zero?
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
You knew it was me all along?
[Lionheart, what happened?]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
But why attack an Agent?
350 miles.
It didn't feel that way.
Are you calling Her?
What kind of car do you drive?
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
Tell me about it...
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Anything?
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
You haven't told then, huh?
No.
Let me just check on my boy.
...And she's with someone else.
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Huh?
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Why not?
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Me too.
It's not going to well?
Hello?
Lorraine?
Are you on the other line?
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
Fine... I guess. You?
Yeah.
I miss you, Mike.
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
No problem.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
How many strokes?
It's unbelievable.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
Then why won't she call...?
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Don't call me ever again.
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
That's right.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
When?
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Vegas.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
What?!?
What an asshole.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
...gotta...
Baby, you did fine.
I gotta use the phone.
No, baby. You're money.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
What?!?
How you guys doing?
We got the digits, baby.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
Is she looking now?
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
Yes she did.
...we're not...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...Tomorrow, then a day.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...Shut up, Sue...
Be smart about it.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
What miracles you do for strangers.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
No, I wanted other things for you.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
Yes.
Don Tommassino.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
Ever seen anything like that before?
Mike!  The party starting!
Who are those girls?
Mike!
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
Jesus, I don't know...
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Did he give you his politicians?
No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You wouldn't like him.
Michael, I love you.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
Michael, what are you doing?
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
I'm busy.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
You just woke up!
Is that good?
I'll come down.
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
Marge and I are getting married.
I love Marge.
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
What about Christmas?
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
I just don't believe that!
Okay.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
What does that mean?
He hates being confronted.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
How would you know that?
So you found Peter...
Randall.
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
So -- are you travelling under R?
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
It's okay.
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
It's okay.
Hello. What are you up to?
How was it?
Well that would be even better gossip.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Absolutely.
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Where do you live?
What kind of people?
That's really something.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
What's wrong?
Well... mostly...
Hello, Travis.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
More people watch it.
Oh, are you all right?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Betsy, come over here a moment.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Yeah.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Huh?
You carry a piece? You need one?
20 bucks?
Why you hang around with them greasers?
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Well, I tried.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
I... I don't get along with people like that.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
Nice talking to you, Travis.
How's your driving record?
Twenty-six.
No, I want long shifts.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Oh?
Anything you say, officer.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
Don't stop...  do no stop.
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
Surprise, surprise.
I'm not a fool, Billy.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
Well...
You look... different.
How'd they get it inside?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Now, did you remember that, or...
Thanks.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
I do.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Harry, son.  Harry.
And... what's my name again?
When did I leave?
Yes?
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Did I what?
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Then I'll call you a cab.
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
That's where you live.
Aren't you coming?
Jesus.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
What's his rent?
Huh?
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Yeah, well, that's enough.
So, it is a blacklist.
What do you mean?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
Will you help me, Sandy?
Yes?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
San Francisco.
How'd you happen to come here?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
When was this?
Different?
A trifle.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
I see.
And the second?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Do you think I should go?
That's up to you.
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
Could I have a puff?
I don't think your mother would like that.
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Don't you like us?
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
I wonder if you could help me.
Try my best.
See them two big trees across there?
I see. How do I get down there?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmm.
I wonder if you could tell me...
Yep?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
Gulls!
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
In a bird shop.
I know, Mother.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
I know, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
Do I sound foolish to you?
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
Lovebirds, sir?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
I understand completely, sir.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Some of them are.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
Ahhh, but I know you.
What are you? A policeman?
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
What made it...
Do you practice here?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Certainly, but...
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Why did he shoot her?
He was watching a ball game on television.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
Will I be seeing you again?
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
But you tore it up.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
What do you want ?
Cheers.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
What do you do?
Helping travelers.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Last night? What do you mean?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
Some cream?
So they united.
Melanie...
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
There we are!
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
Well? And are you not a good student?
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
But this woman -- and her son --
She's unconscious.
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
No.
You've no thought of going there?
I thought this was a school day.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Can anyone hear what we say?
Burke them?
I come from Lisbon.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
How long ago?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
Check and mate.
Fuck! What do you want?
Sssshhh. She's resting.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
No. You don't.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
Yeah, we do.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Doubt is a motherfucker.
You mean Alex.
But you, you've had them.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Why are there so many?
What were you yelling about?
Are you ok?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
I think I dropped an earring.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
You wrote this?
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Maybe a little demonstration.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Yes, I have!
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Where is that?
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Why not, Bobby?
I don't believe it.
How does he explain that?
About five months -- your months.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
I don't like horror comics.
How do you like Santa Carla?
Can't stand light?
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Honda 250, huh?
We were gonna grab some food.
What?...
Where's Star, David?!
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Thanks, Grandpa...
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
See you later.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
Help me, Mom.  Help.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Where's Michael?
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Ouch.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Take laddie.
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
Go away.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
I'm making you a sandwich.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Star.
What do you want from us?
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
You can't let anybody leave!
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
What's happening?
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
You ain't tying me up.
Anything?
I guess you're okay.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
You reach anybody yet?
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
We going to make it?
Maybe it ain't coming.
You hear that?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
Sir... have you a name?
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
Yes.
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
Vox --
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
You took her because she helped me.
That was a foolish thing to do.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
You're late.
Well there's something new.
Talk away, Professor.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Got here as soon as I could.
Alex, what is it?
No... let's walk through the city.
We took a walk three days ago.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
Oh?
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
I'm sorry, David.
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
Why don't you come to our house instead?
This... was my home.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
That machine --
Yes.
I don't understand.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
You know this?
Yes.
Kalen...
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
You know that's not true.
No, you're safe --
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Relax.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
You sure you know where to find one?
Who are you?
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
What should they be looking for?
Sure.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
But no one knew until after...
[Beat] You bled to death.
What?
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
Then, where are you going?
I could try to...make it stop.
No. I don't want it to.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
What were you talking about the other day?
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
You want a drink?
This is pretty good. Considering...
[Beat] Why?
How?
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
In the leg.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
You girls are in some hot water.
How are things goin' out there?
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
That's certainly possible.
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Peaches.
Am I in trouble?
Louise.  Where are we going?
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
What do you mean?
Give me the keys.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Did you finish thinking?
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Thelma.
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Whaddo we do?
You mean now or before?
Like a Chihuahua?
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
You do?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
God!  It looks like the Army!
What are you talkin' about?
You're a good friend.
You women are crazy!
Where you goin'?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
The thing's kind of heavy.
No harm, no foul?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
I'm asking you to leave.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Mary again.
Whatever happened to Mary?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
His mother?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
Hm?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Who?
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Here's the info you asked for.
Stalker, huh?
Very nice.
Nineteen months I been sober.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
By the way, what's your name?
How'd you know that?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
Are you... an architect?
No, I mean
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
Yeah.
I guess.
What?
Come on, what were you going to say?
Oh my.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Nice.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
You were following us?
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Meaning?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Magda!
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Please leave.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
So what's up?
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
How are you doing, Warren?
See you, Warren.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
Then they should speak up.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
How long until the army is ready?
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Hello?
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
What journey?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
What the hell you doing?!
Six rounds. 357.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
I'll sleep around a little.
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
What was he saying?
That's not solid.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Jesus. Oil?
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
What?
No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
Come back?
Mister Tully.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
No way. No fuckin' way.
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
It isn't?
How so?
You saw a MiG 21?
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
Too aggressive?
I can't.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
How about what?
You want to go ballistic?
Food...and you...my F-14!
What?
Not to me.
True.
Off me or off you?
Well what?
Yes, Sergeant?
What is he doing?
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
I've got it -- hold on!
Is there something I should know?
But I have to!
Well what?
On what?
Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
How was it?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Come on, we're next.
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
1000.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
Hear about Ice?
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
Figured out what?
Need a hint?
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
Bad?
Was going.  Now you are.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
For the same reason you are.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
My wife's house.
Or....
What to the rebels want?
What happened to number five?
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Thank you.
Fuck you.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
But I thought...
Two-headed monsters?
What do you want?
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
HER!
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Where's Kuato?
I don't know.
Oh, Rekall.
Harry, what the hell is this?
Just think about it.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
That a problem?
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
Secret agent...How much is that?
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
I guess he didn't.
...What?
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Don't be ridiculous.
So you dropped by to apologize?
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
What's wrong?
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
You can't fight'em that way...
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
So...now what?
Why?
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
What the hell are you doing?!!
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
Burt!  Heather!
Think it's still following us?
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Ms. Vin's sister.
I have to talk to your brother.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
"We"?
We had a description of the suspect.
Not at all --
We have a full caseload, Rog.
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
A fucking wheelchair?
Eddie Dowd.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
What's Art Esparza?
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Murder witness.
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
-- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
You tell me, man.
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
-- Every word.
What do you want?
-- Roger --
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
Shu's the only one I know of...
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
I want you to kill for me.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Well, where are you going?
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
An old woman and her grandson.
Was there an argument?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
OK, Gordon.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
He's dead -- good and dead.
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
Shorthand. Really?
Oh, the uncle is missing.
A blue rose.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
She lived alone.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Laura?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
You missed somethin', Ed.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
Who would do that?
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
Why? It does.
It does matter. We're in love.
James...
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
When he finds out.
Bobby killed a guy.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
School?
No.
Dad?
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
As if I didn't know.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
Abrams...
I'm fine.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
How good's your intelligence?
...tell me about this case.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Yes.
What is the truth?
What does it mean?
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
I wouldn't do it.
I thought I would need it.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Orthopedics?
...of Anesthesiology?
Objection, we've...
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Nothing further, your Honor.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
We went to Code Blue...
And what did your team do...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
The Doctors were not negligent.
I. Yes. It is.
And you wrote that...
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Yes.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Yes.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
Nothing further, your Honor...
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
And are they going to get it?
I've got to work.
Who told you that?
Thank you.
Yes. Price...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
...I understand...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Hi, Mickey...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
...Gruber's not bad.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She did?
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
Don't you live at home?
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
So is the town, I notice!
It's always been a good persuader.
That's their position?  You've certainly got them surrounded.  I suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
We will, sir!
They are living creatures out there.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
And I...I've got other things happening.
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Guess so.
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
Home.
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
What...what is that?
When do you think it'll be done?
Seemed, not was.
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
What are you talking about?
Heather Langenkamp?
Yes.
The car's no there yet?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
He would have loved this.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
What?
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Yeah.
I know.
You know, I never had friends like this.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Can we talk?
I gotta go.
But that's not the point...
Yes.
Passport?
How ya doing?
Do what?
Ya know... "It".
Where are you from any way?
That's how he died you know.
Uh, huh.
Shouldn't we turn away?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
It has nothing to do with him.
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
And being sixteen.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
Don't ever call me stupid.
That's not a satisfactory answer.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Well, that was neighborly.
What are we supposed to talk about?
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
No, sir.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
It wasn't hard.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
This be it?
Y'all take American Express?
Yessir.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
I'm from all over.
No.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Why should it?
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
No shit?!?! You know him?
Gas?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
Oh, many things...
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
But I'm wild at heart.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
What brand'd she smoke?
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
Here she goes again...
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
Come look at this.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
How'd you know my daddy?
Yeah, I'm here.
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
One bad car accident...
You sick?
Sailor? You know what?
Love you, too.
Oughta make 'em happy.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
You must be my son.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
Mama???
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Just a place.
Six.
What do you want me to do about it?
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Explain it... I told you.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Santos... I can't...
What?
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Your wife.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
I just mean...
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
That was good.
Yes.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
You must be mistaken.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
The last month maybe.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
Boy or girl?
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
They're glass. The buttons.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
What'd he say?
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Afraid so.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
I never heard of it.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
I eat.
When?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
And? Are you going to tell him?
You heard? How?
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
Grady.
Are you sure you parked it there?
He told you.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
I'm not sure that's possible.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
It's Grady, Walter.
It's three-thirty, Grady.
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Is it good?
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Annette? She's good... tense.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
C'mon, Walter.
It's not what you think.
Were you watching me?
You don't know?
You can't talk to me like --
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
I don't know.
What?
Know what?
No.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
I count my blessings.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
I don't understand.
That's right.
You have no feelings for your niece?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
You mean my problem?
Why?
What the hell are you doing there?
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
Are you?
K through sixth.
You must hate it.
You're still here.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
You think I have a problem?
It's been a while since...
Why do you want to know?
Molested little girls?
Why don't you just go now, okay?
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
All three -- in chronological order.
I'm not scared.
Live together.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
I'm not scared.
How you guys doing?
I think you were worried about me.
I haven't worn mine in months.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
No.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
But what did he see that made him panic?
If you say so.  It could be anything.
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
Try again.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hello, Brigman.
Got it. Over.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Quiet!  Quiet!
SHIT!
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
He can still make it.
When do you have to go back?
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
But you just said that a month was too...
This one is gorgeous.
Used to what?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes, very much so.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Then I'll see you later.
Aren't you going to change?
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
Tell me once more.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
What is it?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
And where do you find the models?
Don't you ever paint men?
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
And what did they say about me?
Anything new develop?
Unfortunately, no.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Don't worry, we've got everything.
You know, I don't love anybody.
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
Through someone else?
One of the other Sisters?
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
It made them holy.
I burnt them.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
No I'm not.
What would you like to talk about.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Right now?
Uh huh.
Often?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
No. I was sick.
Where did the baby come from?
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
Like what?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
Why not?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Is that what she said?
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Not my fault.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
She's dead isn't she?
How?
She...
She says my whole body's a mistake.
And then...
Yes.
No.
Why?
It grew.
Would you like to tell me?
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Yes.
She said Michael.
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
She'd seen him too.
Stay away from me...
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
What?
Why?
All I want is one more week.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
How do you survive?
Yes.
How did she hide it during the day?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
And what happened?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
What?
I am...
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
We'll see about that.
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
No, it reminds me.
Hand rolled.
Right...
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Where is she?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Did you know she was pregnant?
No!
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Shurrup!
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah.
Shurrup!
Can you fix him for me?
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Get him out of here!!
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Ringo!
Is he?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Pity.
You can learn from books.
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Oh ... I dunno.
A book!
Where are you off to?
Me!
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
What are you doing?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
Come on let's get this coffee.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Clean though, isn't he?
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
I hope he fell off.
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
No, not me.
Oh yes.
That's what you tell me.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
What do you think are you're up to?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
Eh, what's all this?
Oh... God... am I cold...
Cattle ranch!
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Where the hell are we?
Is it solid?
Close enough to walk to!
Looks like a derelict.
Just machinery.
What's up?
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Can we come up?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
What's wrong?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Yes!
How long to fix?
Hard to say.
Hello, Faust!
What do you mean?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
And when will you be ready to do that?
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
Sounds like a rough one.
It will be.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
Now what's wrong?
How many?
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
What's happening up here?
That must have been when he got it.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
What's wrong?
That sounds a little fanciful...
How?
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Where are we?
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Found what?
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
Would somebody fill me in?
What film?
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
We won't need it then.
Food-storage room!
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Let's get back and call this in.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Give or take.
Where is she?
Where're they headed?
How much air-time have I got?
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
What the hell are you doing?
Alright, okay.  Look...
But I'm going first...
What?  Where?
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
And...?
That's what we thought.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Okay, we're in business.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Think I spoke too soon...
What can I do?
How do you know my name?
It needn't be.
That's right.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
I don't think that's funny.
Just like it.
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Why'd call me a killer?
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
You can have one at Max's.
I was there. An eyewitness.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Didn't you know?
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill!
Huh?
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
Then you're crazy.
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
How is Eve? Okay?
Happy little housewife...
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
- guilty.
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
What fire and music?
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
Well, I am.
It's not nonsense.
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
With the paper to prove it.
Why?
Everything.
I'm for it.
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
How do you do, my dear.
You don't like Eve, do you?
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
What report? To whom?
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
He's the best.
Oh, no. I see the play.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Not just that way. As a friend...
Mrs. Richards.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
I'm not crying.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Addison wants me to play it.
Not at all...
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
The curtains. I made them myself.
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
Why not?
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
What time is it?
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
I'm trying hard to follow you.
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
With gestures, of course.
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Where is she?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
I mean really, deeply angry...
What's your being married got to do with it?
Call, what call?
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
All you got to do is name it.
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
July of '71.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
What's that?
And?--And?--
Were you eyebrow reading?
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
--we will--
You want me to be the bastard.
Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
--shit--
--we gotta top the Times--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
Woodward?
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
Five hundred; six maybe.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
So tell me about the Times article.
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
--this'll only take one second--
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
To where?
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
What?
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Lotsa hints--
Who's Charles Colson?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
That was awhile ago.
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
I'll do it.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
What do you suppose they're saying?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
You can call me Oz.
I'm glad you think so.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Because I want to.
Stifler told me.
So you're going to Michigan?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
So we're gonna be close next year?
What about the game?!
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No.
Of course.
Fuck me!  Yes!
You can crash at Stifler's?
Holy shit.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
You did it.
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Uh...
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Let me know.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
Hey...
Victoria...I love you.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Hey.  I got another question for you.
Then she said -- she loves me.
Contact, dude.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
...Guess what?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Sure. I can follow that.
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
This looks familiar...
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
We don't both have to die.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
The ADM. Let's go.
Oh shit... No...
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Andy? Andy is that you?
Where is it! Please!
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Why were you so late tonight
Who did you hear it from?
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
What a beautiful ship!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
I'm sorry.
I'm so scared...
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
I'm getting a chest cold..
Bartok... a question.
What do you want?!
No. Empress, you --
I should go
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Yes.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
Allison.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
M'm.
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
So sorry.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Okay.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Fifteen years, yeah.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
It's terrific.
What?
Gimme a kiss.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
H'm?
M'hm.
Look, look at that guy.
Look at these guys.
Yeah.
Mine.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
M'hm.
Yeah.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
Yeah.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
Oooh.
Yeah.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Check it out.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Yeah, this place is great.
Oh, good. Okay.
God.
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
This is my room.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
My head is throbbing.
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
I mean that as a compliment.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
So the colored have enough trouble.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Oh. What about?
Hey-
It was a wonderful set.
There's a whole wing in this house.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
I was very charming.
Would it make a difference?
She's a constant surprise.
And you've only just met.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
No, what?
The movie.
What?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
I'm not.
Why didn't you bring him?
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
When does he graduate high school?
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Let me heal you, baby.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Not as a rule.
Go.
Hey!  Would you?
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
Probably not.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
You want me to uninvite her?
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Two minutes.
Truce?
Truce.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
That is not true.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
What are you saying?
Hello?  Last birthday was?
This is insanity.  Sally...
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
Me too.
It's a Calder.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Sure.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
You got your DP?
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
I've never done this before.
Lemon.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
The Shostakovich.
Really??
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
If he were still alive, maybe.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Fuck you, Panes.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
I never like to talk about my work.
No.  Not something new.
That's not an answer, is it?
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Hm.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
Wait!  When can I see you again?
Divinely?
No...as a matter of fact...
Quiet -- sshhh!!
Hlllllllp!
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
And only you can become a Queen?
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
Who is that idiot?
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Barbatus!
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Why are we so successful?
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
Sheldrake?
Why?
Really?
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Eight-thirty.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
You all right? What's the matter?
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
I think so.
Here.
You don't want me here --
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
Who?
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Give what up?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Do I have to?
You sure you want to throw that card?
Who was that?
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
There's a call for you --
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
In the knee?
I see you bought some napkins.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
I never thought he'd do it.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
This?
Yes, of course.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
Sir?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
What do you mean, sorry?
Now you're being bright?
No I didn't.
Baxter?
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
On account of me.
Mr. Sheldrake?
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Me?
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
What about him?
That so.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
No.
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
The party's over.
Kubelik.
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
Doctor.
What for?
Let me take that.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
You know I do.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Stop that, Fran.
Where do you live?
Where does she live?
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
It won't happen again.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Yeah --
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
One for all -- all for one --
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
Part.
North ?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
I was an FO for the 25th.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
How long were you up there ?
Holy shit.
Chef.
... he's an amazing officer.
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
What're you trying to say, Captain --
What is it?
Will they attack?
Who knows? Right.
What do you want ?
Touchy.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Charlie?
I thought he was a lame.
About what ?
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
We don't want to bother you any, we --
The wind --
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Boss left.
What do you mean?
How big it is?
Change.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
Do you?
How did we get here?
I had immense plans.
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Maybe he'll get tubed.
Are you finished surfing?
Yeah... thanks.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
No -- no, Captain.
Sure.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
Simple. They don't want him to go.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
What if I say no.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Right now -- I am.
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
...I won't let a killer walk!
165  CONTINUED:  
My dad was a Navy doctor.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
Have you talked to Eric?
What happened here?
Where'd you say Eric is?
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Did you catch Corbett?
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Where's Corbett?
Leave it here.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
I already have.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Huh?
Go ahead.
What is it you want? What?
Do you love me?
Emergency room only.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
I've got Jews at my table.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
Uh, Udall?
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
I'm not kidding.
Getting loud, getting loud.
No... no thank you notes.
I can't. I work.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Hello?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Hey -- you let him...
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
I'll take you... why not?
I can trust my brain.
Were you asleep?
You know what? I...
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Was this supposed to be your room?
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
But what about...
One night with me!
What the heck are those for?
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
How's Verdell doing?
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
What?
Actually, I don't think so.
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Now we'll both call him.
You consider your life easy.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Because...  ... you love her?
But you know where you're lucky?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Is there a problem?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What?
How long have you been freelance?
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
Oh, yeah.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Game over, bitch!
I'm on the scent.
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
I don't know what the fuck you are.
I know what happened.
I bet you fucking know!
Yeah.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Okay.  How did you find me?
He wants to kill you?
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
No.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
How did you get into the business?
How old were you?
Why not?
The exotic women.
Why not?
Because you are a women.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
My first take?
Why?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
That's fiction.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Where is it?
Yes.
In Costa Blanca.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
For Nicholai?
How do you know they're not?
Nobody ever sees me.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Why?
What?
Can I ask you something?
It happened to you before?
What happened to her?
She was taken.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
Honestly?
Was nice.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
I prefer it like this.
Do you believe that?
Is that all you want?
It's a common question.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Taken.
Anything.
Why didn't you fade?
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
But how did the wall get here?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
We're going to need it all.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
He got that one right.
So?
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
Some deal you did there!
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
What?
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
It's not so much.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
Why don't we both forget about him?
It's Josh's.
This is your doing?
How do I know this isn't a trap?
Would you like your things now?
Hey Doug, where you been?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
But I have to finish this....
I don't want to go.
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
What are you an idiot!
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
A late night or an early morning?
I told him to leave me alone.
Now it's okay?
Hypotheticals --
Landon!
-- Your act only works with an audience.
Why?
What's with the friggin numbers?
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Because I try to be nice to people?
In ten words or less?
My relationship with God is my own.
Yeah --
Or anywhere where people might see us.
It's not.
And why would that scare me?
It's a start.
I have to get you home by one.
Before we do this.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Pull over.
Now? We just --
Can I -- go out?
Did you give him a gift?
Dad --
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
For Jefferson High. For books.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Uh, yes, sir...
The sunrise? What for?
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
Huh?
Why?
Your line, George!
Not a holocaust --
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Operator, what's today's date?
What year?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
But Professor --
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Pardon me?
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Well, it was there.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
Perfect...
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
Okay.
I used to throw trash for the City.
You lost that one?
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Nothing.
There you go.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Well, I got homework.
Yeah.
You know what I think?
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Just thinking.
It's mine all right.
Hold it right there.
You tossed my hat out the window.
Not me. No way.
There's another one we owe 'em.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
You're a welcome sight...
We will, old fried, we will.
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
Go away.  Let me rot?
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
You don't wanna know.
Never.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
Not here!  No Overthruster!
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
I see.
Hello, Barton.
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
I want to know!
Hah!
Ever talk to him?
What else?
I'm sorry, I just feel like I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
Ever act?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
A souse!
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Yes... Isn't it?
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Yeah, but 
...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Jesus... They can tell that...
Jesus, Charlie, I...
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me  Charlie.
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
Congratulations.
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
Excuse me?
...Those your only bags?
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
Yeah.
Who?
No, Nick, please --
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
I thought you hardly know her.
What do you want, Nick?
What did she tell me, Beth?
I had him in two classes.
Did I miss something?
Sure.
You know all about me.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Didn't you study it in school?
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
How exactly did you hear?
Do you?
Fine.
Ice?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
Why take the risk?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
Did you think it was so special?
Did you like her to watch?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
What are you researching?
What happens to them?
It won't sell.
I hate rugrats.
How did he die?
You have the right to an attorney.
You workin' on another book?
It teaches you to lie.
How's that?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Routine.
Nope, can't say that I do.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Was she ever suspect?
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
I'm not afraid of her.
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
Catherine says you don't like her.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
Are you kidding me?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Fuck you, Phil.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
She killed him.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
Why do you think he's dead?
Yes I did.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors  anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Cool.
Do you still love her?
Aren't they?
No.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
What do you mean?
I'm here.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Really?
Hey  Willie Mays.
Good. What do you have?
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Guess I just got sick of him.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
It looks done.
What's wrong with me?
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
I really... admire you.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
You see? You have someone to live for.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
Where's the fire?
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Didn't I say that?
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
And the truth frightened her?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
What is it?
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
This is easy.
What exactly are you doing?
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Can he save her?
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
Who's Ivy?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
How about dangerous curves?
I think they're getting worse.
Why do I keep doing this?
Why, indeed?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
Perhaps the fall...
What?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
He's home. I sent the signal.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
To kill me.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Why do you do that?
I'm not-
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
I need to be part of this.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Bruce, you can't.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
How'd you find us?
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
What about the girl?
Is this what you wanted?
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
No.
Maybe we should just kiss.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
And what happens if we say no?
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
And you want a --
Yum, yum.
Peanuts?
Oh, Bruce...
Are they paying you for all this?
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
HOLY SHIT!!
Yeeees?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Scottish.
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
Meaning?
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Goodnight Annie.
Ahm.....
Oh yes.
Howls he getting on with the family?
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
You're not going to ....
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
What makes you say that?
Welsh.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Bye, Dad.
Well, there is that ...
... in the distant future.
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Interesting suit.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Me first!
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Me first.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
No way butt-hole! I want the window.
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Uh, you first.
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Turd-burglar...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Uh... butt-snatch...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Beavis.
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
Did you give him a full cavity search?
You see what I see, Bork?
I see it. I don't get it.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
She sure does.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Really? That's where we're from.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
But <u>we</u> let him out.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
We were trying to scare your mother.
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
We're very unhappy.
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
Are you a spirit too?
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
I don't know what that signal means.
Beetle!
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
W... What is it?
Your qu...?  But you're...
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
It's <u>Otho</u>!
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Okay?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Is this the key to the attic?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Otho, that's terrible.
Oh, fine.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
No, Robert.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
... Do you think we should look for him?
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Do you know Raphael?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
A Black man gave me the message.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
I hope you're comfortable.
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Our greenhouse.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
Yes. That could be true.
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
I agree.
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
Yes, I understand.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
I can't write.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
... My suitcase.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Yes. That is surprising.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
Have you served in the Army?
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
Good morning, Mr. President.
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Try again.
Yes, ma'am.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
Look, Johanna...
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
No, sir.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
That could be possible...
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
I never played a jewel thief.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Which one is Elijah again?
Why, Craig. why?
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Hmmm.
She's very beautiful.
The ferret?
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
Why aren't you at work?
Why?
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
What about Maxine?
Tell her you need to see her.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
Maxine...
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
So how was it?
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
I said "yes."
Security.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Yes, well...
Yeah.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
That's the usual?
You're a fag or a liar.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
Lotte? Is that you?
Hello. Wendy.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Vegas? What'd you think?
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Why not? I need to get in there!
Yes?
When?
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Come on in.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Sleepy suddenly.
Captain Mertin?
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You still know.
No. Sorry.
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
You don't sit with me!!
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Well, good luck with the job.
Oh.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
No. I mean work work.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
She likes this dress...
He ask, I give him anything.
Aw, no, Ella.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
For what?
Just me.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
Jesus.
You don't know what I think.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
Oh, man, don't say that..
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
That is for the urn.
They range up to three thousand.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
Am I wrong?
Different mothers, huh?
In the briefcase?
...Also, my rug was stolen.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Oh yeah?
"Johnson"?
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Well...yeah--
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Well yeah...I know that.
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
No, but--
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Am I wrong!
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Whose toe was it, Walter?
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Is the car out front yours?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
You know this!
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Dude here.
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Right, Dude.
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Did I urinate on your rug?
Who the hell is he?
Oh, shit.
Bullshit. Walter!
Impressive.
He's half yours, partner.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
You're hurt.
What about Nomak?
how long since he was bitten?
Recognize him?
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Why do you hate us so much?
You're hurting me.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Your security's for shit, kid.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
So?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Not that I'm in contact with.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
You're blind --
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
How did you know?
But he's a policeman --
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Are you all right?
I've been better --
Is it bad?
Get out of here --
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
Deacon brought me back.
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
You're a monster.
I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race.
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Why do you hunt them?
He killed them?
How did you escape?
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
What happened to her, where did she go?
No.
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
Why are we here?
--how old?
Looks like business is booming.
Cheery little place.
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
Nothing. I dunno--
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
Turn the tapes back on.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Can't you like just divine it?
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
No.
What're you, crazy??
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Where's Domini?
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
Be it still alive, James?
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
Nobody's going anywhere--
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
--Cotter--
What're you doing?
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
What is all this shit?
Women miscarry all the--
What'd you see?
--bullshit--
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
Your mother's pastor.
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
Thanks, Meurice.
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
...Ray?
Where... where you going?
Well... the couch would be all right...
...Well I'll be damned.
...Mm-hmm.
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
...That's what's important.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...Who?
...What's going on with you two?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
I own the place.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
He needs a room, Dusty.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
I told you. I like you.
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
How would I know?
Right. Sorry.
What.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Thanks Meurice.
I've seen a few.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Okay.
The criminals are winning.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Yes, but.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
I . I don't know.
Do you like the way I feel?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Don't say that.
I liked being with you last night.
Do you like my body?
Are you a bad boy?
Yes.
Beeeee careful.
I asked first.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Oh no.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
What?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Yeah, how did you know?
What else is new?. right?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
I guess you have to get back home soon?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Oh, okay. can I call?
What did you see?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
Goodnight.
You were late.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Jeffrey?. Why?
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Look Jeffrey.
uh uh.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
That sounds great!
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
Nothing like this back home.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Excuse me?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
No.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
I heard.
Good night.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Please, continue.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
I'm calling it three.
What?
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
In how long?  A week?
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
What do you guys want?
George.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
What are you doing here?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
Shhhh.
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
For instance, something like this?
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Yeah?
So?
No shit, Kevin?
The strike is a success; but ...
Dien Bien Phu?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
With an unloaded pistol?
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
Then don't complain.
Read it.
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
So -- where do we start?
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
What did they argue about?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Sit down, Frank.
Objection!
No -- but I can get it for you.
What about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Tell the court about that, please.
How did he look?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
Why not?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
No.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
No.
Then -- those are not your own words?
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
P.M.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Yes.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
What do you think?
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Nothing.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Yes -- it would be nice.
Why would she lie?
You don't need anybody.
No -- he's lying.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
But Your Honor--
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
She sounds like quite a woman.
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
It was a place to start.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
How bizarre!
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
Grateful!?
Then why do you?
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
Nobody did.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
She's changed.
They got heat in Michigan.
Heat is heat.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Oh. How old?
About a year and a half.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
Much.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
Are you all right?
Francesca?
What?
Woman friends, too?
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
But it's not the same.
My mistake. I apologize.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
No. I was just... No.
Oh, sure. Great.
Yeah?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Yes.
I sat outside and had coffee.
What were you like when you were younger?
Trouble. Why?
I can't do this, honey.
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Yes, thanks.
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
How do you know what I experience?
Stop it!
Then he can move! People move!
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
No. Don't do this.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
'Bout 4:30.
I can't sleep.
Franny?
What's her name?
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
He yours, sir?
Then what do you care?
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
That's what?
Looking to score?
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
You know I can't.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
I can't.  Not yet.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
You got the cash?
Did you do it?
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Please...help me...
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Not really to live, just to play.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
You want to get into this now?
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
Open the case!
The money!
We're family, Caesar.
I can't.  I can't.
Oh, shit ...
So, you just got out?
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
What are you talking about?
You mean they weren't up here?
No!  They're still on their way.
He didn't see you, did he?
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Okay, sure, Mick.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Is that the money?
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
So this is temporary for you?
Thanks.
Not exactly.
Okay, one drink.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
You have to ask?
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Almost five years.
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
What was it then?
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
Do you think you know me like that?
It's in a case, on his desk.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Yeah.
I'm just asking, what if?
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Hey.
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
Pop?
Oh, God.
Yes.
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
And what if I couldn't do that?
-- he went inside! --
Treadstone.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
That's all I get?
Jason Bourne is dead.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
I don't know.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Yes.
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
Yes.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
It's a little late for that.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
I needed a break.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
-- there's no time --
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
What is that?
This your store?
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
He run away often?
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
What's that?
What?
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
What if it doesn't come back?
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
...Be back.
...ergency procedures.
Machines don't fix themselves.
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
...ven't you?
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
What? You mean you've got ...
It's reply paid.
You don't have to sing it.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Jack!
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Remember how they used to stick out?
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
You killed him?
I'm sure you have
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Why?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
How do you think I feel? You shit!
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Stamped?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
You know, smoking's bad for you.
It's my fucking life.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
They'll be there waiting.
Will you please turn back.
Let go! We've got to stop!
Yes.
Don't do anything silly.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Tuttle?
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
What?
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Ha!!
But ... I called Central Services.
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
The pace?
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
What do they want you or?
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
Es impossible.
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
He looks like a cop.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
What did you say?
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Oh man, Bucky.
Yes.
Did you see my father?
No.
She should go home.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
Sleeping.
He's better, though, right?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
He'll be all right.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
I hate vodka.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Where you going?
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
No.
Would you like to come in?
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
Why?
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
What?
Faster! God!
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
Keep it to yourself.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
What?
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
You know what I...
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Eventually rising to...
Sure.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Nine seconds.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Did you shoot their boots?
What happened?
Watch? --
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
I didn't know you were going with him.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
No.  You know that I'm not.
How?
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
So who's the guy?
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Move away from me.
What did he say?
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
Follow me.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
Hi.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
What do you mean clean?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
What?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Why, you need me for the story?
It's incredible who's here.
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
What?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
This is very awkward.
What are you doing here?
Oh it's enough...
Whaddya mean?
Yes Walter.
You think I'm creative?
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
I'm sorry about what I said before.
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Walter...there's...
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
Walter...I can't believe it.
Maybe so...
Are you alright?
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
What did he say?
Didn't you hear him?
You...made that?
Dead Cat?
I didn't mean to.
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
You didn't mean to what?
It's hot in here...
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Man has a complex.
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
Suck!
Excellent.
Hi, Buffy.
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Something like that.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
You're even weaker than the others.
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Hi.
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
I'm going to the dance.
He did what he was supposed to.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Bugs.
Beverly Center.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I'm looking for you, actually.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Meet me at this address after school.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Sporting events, yeah.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Here?
Put your head back.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Don't start with me again.
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
No THX.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
So very much.
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Buffy?
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
They'll kill us!
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
All right.  Take care of yourself.
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
It's Skip, for you.
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
See my hips?
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
You got me all confused.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
Why baseball?
What?
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Which one of us?
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
Who's he play for?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
If you believe in Voodoo.
Beg me!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
But he ain't seen my heat--
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
I'm going to the Show.
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
And where can I go?
Step outside, pal.
I don't believe in fighting.
I'd kill ya.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
She's playing with my mind.
Jim looking for somebody.
Was I at that dinner?
Was I at that dinner?
This is a very auspicious occasion.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
Lester...
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
Eight.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
Okay.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
Hello.
My wife?
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Why?
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
I just told you. She called me.
Sammy.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
You've got to stop her.
No, Ace.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Now, he's really pissed.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
Yeah, how do I know?
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What do you mean?
I gotta tell ya...
...twenty-five thousand?
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Mm-hm.
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
Oh...
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
I wouldn't -
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
Eight children! 
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Okay, I'll -
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Yeah, okay.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
You're firin' me?
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
No, no? You didn't?
You shut up.
You gotta go back out there.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Hey.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
He's gone?
He's not here?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
I'll be there.
What? What?
You know?
You did. You're right.
Yes, you did.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Yeah.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
All right. Be careful.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Thank you. Very nice.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Get lost?
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
Okay, then.
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Mm-hm.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
I took care of everybody.
This is Nick.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
I know. I know.
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Whoa. Calm down.
Take it easy!
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Charlie M?
How you doin'?
Well, I'm a little confused here.
My fuckin' head.
Hey! Oh!
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
Yeah.
Hi.
You know, nobody likes you...
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
Hmm. Not bad.
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Pass!
Yeah, this is better than rape.
What a "drag."
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
What's the name of your child's best friend?
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
But I'm blind.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Taking messages.
What if they do question the authenticity?
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
You gotta just look the other way.
Lady, don't let him do it!
How do we get back to the freeway?
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
And stop with the directions.
Make a "U" and go back.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
Any minute.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Lady, try making some sense.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
I don't want to know --
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
How much time do you have left on it?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
What do you do for a living?
Pictures.
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
You can't give up.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Yes sir.
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Who's in back?
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
That's not good enough.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Who are you working for?
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
They saw you kill the driver.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Don't worry.
Who am I talking to?
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
How do you know?
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Why are you picking on me for?
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Hold on.
I already called for an ambulance.
I thought so.
It takes all types.
What would you call it?
That's what he said. Jimmy.
An excellent quality.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Fuck off, Dave.
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
No, of course not, she's a lady.
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
Who?
Guy I work with.
Who's she?
You want me to ask you in, right?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Shouldn't I go?
Did he come here too?
You mean that?
I'm thinking of your man.
Even now.
You mean that?
Kind of liked you as a girl.
So I'm sorry.
No. Can't pretend that much.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Dil, this is Jude.
Shouldn't be, Dil
She from Scotland too?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You heard what I said, Dil?
You knew my Jody?
You killed my Jody
No.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
Thirty-five.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Did you give him it?
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
Perfect.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Yes?
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
Yes.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
What do you mean you can't?
How is it a farce?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
No. It's the truth.
I'm not a gambling man.
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
C'mere.
And you play cricket?.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Hurry up, would you?
Why?
Having a pint in the Rock.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Don't think that way.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Don't.
Help me.
When I was a child...
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
Who gives a fuck.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
You're crazy --
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
But I didn't kill anybody.
Then say it.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Ours.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Oh.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
Who?
That's not Carson Dyle.
Carson?
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Around one.
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Brian.
But you're -- divorced?
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
You'd lie about anything.
Then who does?
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Me?
Carson Dyle is dead.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Yes, but we're divorced.
You can't.
There must be some way.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Why can't you be serious?
What are you doing?
Maybe.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
What's so illogical about that?
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Well!
Go on.
You mean, you're a thief?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
Monsieur Félix -- ?
The money is unimportant.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
What do you mean, no?
Yes.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know. I suppose so.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Please, not on my account.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Is your husband with you?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Come on. You can't stay here.
Hallo, Peter.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
So they think he left it with you.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
But why do you want a divorce?
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
She's my daughter, Tom.
You're grounded Friday night!
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
You know her?
You were eavesdropping.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
No!
You found her?
She's not here.
She works at a church?
Your brother told us.
Daddy....
I'm sure you should have failed.
What do you know about my father?
Especially not your dad.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Cut it out.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Did Sharon say no?
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
That's not why we broke up.
I need to ask you something.
Attacked how?
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
The word is Mob.
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Kenny's aunt?
On what side of the family?
You ok?
I got to go.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
You can have both if you want.
Now don't be nervous.
That wasn't me ...
At least somebody likes this shit.

help me get in the truck. 
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Damn.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.

Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 

...town. 
We're clear.
...-er.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
You stole this truck.
...the ice cream for money!
That's...
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.

All right.
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
...-cho and a hijack-...
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
I think...
...we can make it.

 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Come on, old Pete.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
...Pete!  Come on.
Come on.
What the fuck was that?!
...ho!
Hang on!
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
Taking it down the hill.
So you took his...
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.
That is loud!  I'm 
Yeah.
I think you oughta cut a...
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
 

Arlo, shut up.
Oh.


Go, go, go! 
...to him. 
What?
...tunnel!
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
 What's it say? 
It's working.
...-ta get outta here!
 There's gotta be...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's go!
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
Stop limpin' around like that.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
 big balls.
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Well, well, well.
...take my sorry old truck.
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
He's the dude...
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...

Any of them Richard Long?
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
No!
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
Almost quaint.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
...Destry, Fair Oaks....

Dennis!
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
...-fall.
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...noon.
It's a hundred degrees...
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
Mornin'.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.

...should be right outside.
I want you to look at one another...
Your fellow hero, untouched...



Where's Elvis?!

Goddamn it, Ma-...
...it.
Yeah?
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
Ah.
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
Rangers.
...now!
It's not over, Brynner.

Is Elvis out?
That little geek is my...
It must've happened right after we left.
My secret?
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
...fishin'.
 ...or it'll ignite. 
You're the only one I can trust.
 The only one who understands what this me-...
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
 ...miles. 
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
Got that?
So you don't remember...
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
...we're all gonna die in this...
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
Who's the investigating officer?
Do you know him?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
Avocado groves?
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
Haven't the faintest idea.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Oh, my, yes.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
What's that, Curly?
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
I said okay, Jake.
I've been wanting to meet you.
You've done well by yourself.
I get by.
Congratulations.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
Or her name?
What are you doing here?
Isn't that your number?
You accusing me of extortion?
And why's that?
That's it?
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Well, how much would you like?
How did you find out?
Why?
Mr. Gittes.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
No, not for that one.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Over the water department, or over you?
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
You sure shout that?
The Valley?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
As little as possible.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
Yeah.
Just... I have to.
And I want to know where.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
What did he say?  What did he say?
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
Okay, give me the keys.
Did you get some sleep?
That's good. Now what's her name?
With us.
Sophie.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
The obituary column?
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
Only when I breathe.
I never was.
Never?
Sure you do.
Mr. Gittes...
...Yes of course.
All right, what's your husband's first name?
No problem with me on the Job.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Mr. Mulwray, please.
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Not exactly.
Why'd she run away?
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Yes. 
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
Did you ever see her again? 
Father, I have sinned...
For what?
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
Go on!
Ready for dinner, Brad?
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
He made an awful lot of money.
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Do you, Mr. Leland?
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
We haven't heard from him.
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
You really don't know who I am?
Would you sing for me?
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
Poor Mr. Carter!
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
Yes?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
What's wrong, Brad?
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
I'll sign those papers -
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
Yes and no.
Well, thanks a lot.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
No, this is great.
Why aren't there any lights?
Such a sordid state of affair.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
You saw it?
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Was I right?
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
But you were.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
There's more, isn't there?
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
Sang.
He's your fiancé.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
Just me.
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
Are you open?
This is the last time I come to this place.
I can pass!
Who are you to make assessments?
Are you open?
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Well, he missed!
Pack of cigarettes.
So?
Shit!
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
I think it's safe to say yes.
Empire.
All right, Vader's boss...
The Emperor.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
What kind of show?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Which ones?
FUCK!
See? There you go again.
Pull my laces tighter.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Design major.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Why not?
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Twenty-two; same as us.
How'd he die?
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Reach what?
Her fucking body fell out!
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Now I know you're lying.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
She said she did all the work.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
You should shit or get off the pot.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Lovely story.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
To talk to you.
You need a ride?
I'll call you. Let you know.
He's got those love handles.
I'm her sister.
How much can you bench?
What?
One seventy-nine.
What's that mean?
Lasagne.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Actually, it is kind of rough.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
You're kidding.
What were you doing?
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
Oh, you think so?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
Twelve.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Why'd you hit me?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three?
You've only had sex with three different people?
You!
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
What do you mean?
He gets off on it.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Please calm down.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Um. Thirty-seven.
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
A few?
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
Really?  You're the best.
What did he say?
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
I don't want to go back with her...
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
No way!
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Says who?
Willam!
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
A monkey?
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Do you see them yet?
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
You couldn't.
A flare up...
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
A simple yes or no would have done.
Nice view, huh?
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Take the rope.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
What about you?!
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
I burned it.
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
What's he doing?
Yeah...
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Get off my back, Qualen!
He's alive!
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Good evening.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
No. She's dead!
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
Help you.
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
What would you like to know, sir?
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Good.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Fine, fine.
You wanna be sick?
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Are you referring to the background score?
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Oh.
I just say what the other person would say?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Don't read it - sign it!
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Like what?
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
Where are you, what floor?
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
I'm sorry.
Twenty five?
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
I brought you flowers.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Who is this?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
First time in New York?
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
We have a deal.  What's your name?
You - you killed him?
How about the thingy next to it?
You better?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Yes.
Music.
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
I don't know any Rwandans.
How?
Who's that?
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
I don't understand...
Jazz.  Music.
I never learned jazz.
Let's go.
Max?  What are you doing?
She's in the hospital.
Limos, huh?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
Gimme your wallet.
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
You get benefits?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
Head towards Union Station.
Who?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
I never told her.
I don't see the connection.
You going to warn him?
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
Six months.  Eleven days.
You're certifiable.
Who are you, Jerry?
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
What van?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Jerry, I --
What is it?
My father's house.
He gave it to me.
Where were you the day he died?
Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
Thank you.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
Excuse me?
And you have no idea where he lives?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Yes.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
This doesn't make sense.
Which way did he go?
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
That you come with me.
We've lost contact.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Is it possible...?
So?
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
David --
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
With me.
You mean --
I don't understand.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
You aren't staying?
This... seemed best.
Right.  Well.
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
This is how you see the sky?
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Talk to him.
But what do I say?
Could we hear to China?
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
So.  What happens now?
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
Why don't you come back with me?
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
Actually --
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
But what about your research -- ?
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
It's really happening.
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
I flinched.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
I don't follow.
It's getting late...
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
-- I don't know --
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
Hi.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
They don't believe me.
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
Buck is a deal.
Lookit her bounce.
We saw the broads.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
So then you just call him.
But there's still daylight left.
A cold drink? Okay?
Well, whatta we got here?
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
What you mean, Luke?
Do we even get our same bunks back?
I'm in.
Kick a buck.
How about you tryin' to make me?
What?  What'd I do?
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Where is it?
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
For months... last October.
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
That's no surprise.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
What happened to you?!
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Who came in after you?
It's none of my business anymore...
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
Answer it.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
Absolutely.
Sergeant?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
I just got here myself, Susan.
Put in the Kevin Costner.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
What!? They brought the car here?
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Yes.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Can you drive?
Crash victim?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
What?
What's all the dreck?
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'll see you soon.
Green spot.
I wasn't hungry.
He asked me to marry him.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
I love your apartment.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
I guess I should go now.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
That's a big question.
I think we need to talk about some things.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
So will you?
You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
I've met someone else.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
They don't have a murder weapon?
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
It's me...
Oui.
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
Tonight?
For what?
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
Bring me the scissors.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
Do they come with batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
What for?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
Yeah?
We had a deal.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
Everything.
Everything.
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
The Holiday Hotel.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
Me?
You guys used to work together?
How's my brother?
What happened?
Yeah.   It's mine.
Yeah.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
Algeria.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
You ask a lot of questions.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Where's your master?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Hello.  What is your name?
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
You're not married, are you?
What do you think?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Give it back!
Never!
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
You were enlightened?
Have you questioned him yet?
I knew she would intrigue you.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
I don't know...
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
But the sword could be in his compound.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
And you're gonna tell me who.
You don't say.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
At least it finally stopped raining.
Fun -- look at that guy...
In a better place.  I hope.
Well, how's your friend?
Mom tried to cook.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
I don't know you.
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Do you know what you destroyed?
Top Dollar.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
I can see her.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
Oh really?
Shut up.
That's repulsive.
Need a lift?
Give it up.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
What are you doing?
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Need any company?
"I actually feel good about myself?"
Yes it does.
I do not.
Lighten up.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I have feelings for you.
I love you.
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
I don't think that bothered him.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
I'm in the bath, mom.
Why didn't you do something?
If that's what you call it.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
Same time next week?
It works a little.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Oh baby... oh baby...
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Yes!
She bought it.
One.
Ronald?
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Sorry.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Be more specific.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
It was... Fantastic.
You wanted an answer to your question.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
I think you have your answer.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
Ronald? That's crazy.
Let me get that for you.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
Do you know where she is?
She's out.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
You're a lucky guy.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
What do you mean?
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
How?
You get your wish!
Mommy --
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
Something's haywire,
Did you hear the child out?
You're shouting at me.
I thought you were with Amy.
But I told her to go with you.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
It was just a voice.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
But where is that?
I can not tell you.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
That one's an elm.
You mustn't be afraid.
I wasn't singing to myself.
But I only came to give back the ring.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
And does he kill people?
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Good night, mother, good night.
Let the child stay.
On the dark nights  on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
Wow your body's really hot.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
Where are all the mediums?
I think she broke the skin.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
How'd it go with the cop?
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
I wish I only had your problems.
I'm not really hungry after all.
Well, whattdaya think?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
You never say that.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Did you change your hair?
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
You wanna get some coffee?
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
Oh, it's nothing.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
I really gotta get going.
Was there anything in that washer?
You had a date with Carlton?
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
You didn't say it.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
It's for you. Frida.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
And that was 28 days ago today.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
What kind of animal?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
How will we interrogate them?
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
In there.
What is this place?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
Dammit!
Iím your new assistant.
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
You wonít regret this, sir.
Why, yes.
Where are we going?
Where do you think this goes?
You know something about me?
Bad dreams?
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
Is this dangerous or anything?
What's with her?
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
And...
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Clean.
Check his kids.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
When does it break?
Do we have anything on the budget today?
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
I'll lock him away for good.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Presence.
Dave!
Gimme a quarter.
What do you mean you made it all up?
And it's proving quite effective...
Really?
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
What's that?
What are you staring at?
I care about the homeless.
Oh... Yeah.
You sure this goes somewhere?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
Are you hungry?
Yes.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
What?
I never thought I'd...
It could be fun.
We're working on it.
What about the intro?
Please....shoot me.
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Help me get him to the boat.
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
What is it if it ain't a curse?
That sounds like a curse to me.
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
What you wanna do?
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
What'dya get?
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
I don't think they're in school.
Charlie Dalton.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Knox, you gotta calm down.
What is the point?
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
Yeah?  Like what?
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
I think he's sweet.
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Stop what?
But, Chris...
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
A crazy madman.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
You know me, always taking on too much.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
So what do you think of my father?
What?
Nothing.
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
I'll come to the performance.
Visit from my father.
How soon can we get up and running?
Did you clear this?
What other bunch?
Then who are you?
What are you people talking about?
Self sufficient...
Right... You have a boat.
You're saying they can think?
A meat locker.
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
So?
What did you do the my kids!!
Joey...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
What the hell does that mean?
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Fuel up. Need fuel.
I'm telling you, they changed it!
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
I know! I fuckin' know!
You don't!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Fucking A.
Where? Where is he?
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Thanks.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
No?
Nick, she won't say why.
Biederman, yes.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
You can do it, Sal.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
That way it sets.
The shot?
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
What are you, God?
I'm doing that too.
You're right... Okay, you're right.
Forget Sal.
See you Monday.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
Great. Hey. That's great.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
No!
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
Technothugs?
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Funny guy.
I want to see my wife and kid.
Mug sheets.
Give it to me.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
I got it.  I got it.
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
You need anything else?
Maybe I should turn myself in.
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
You be careful.
What's it mean?
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
I didn't.
Young man -- you got me there.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
No! No! I won't.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
Grandma, look at me!
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
What Grange?
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
Mornin', Jabez ...
What's the matter with you?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Why of course --
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Mary --
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
It shows on your face.
You know that, son.
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
You can talk to me ...
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
What's happening?
Ellis, what have you told them?
You...you're an American?
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
'Roy'.
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
So whatsa deal?
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Yes, I would.
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Hey, don't take the car!
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Well...
What trip?
I know!
Where you gonna go?
Why you going to Algeria?
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
I like that... yeah!
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Look... don't throw that on me.
Are they on the phone still?
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
Yeah.
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
Call me Sonny-boy.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
They were ...
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
The gun's right on your back...
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
What?
Where's the air conditioning?
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
You stopped?  Why?
My body?  What for?
He's gone?
Where's the money?
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
What kind of a deal?
Does that still go?
What?
What'd he say?
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Oh my God, mother!
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
Did Pop come down?
Of course not ...
Who the hell is that?
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
Yes.
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Do you know where Danang is?
Not really.
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
Is it a good morning?
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
What responsibilities?
Hurry up and get dressed.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
You are too crude.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
I'm getting paid...
Jade, you're late.
This might take some time.
I'll do.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
How many you say?
Sweet Dick Willie.
That's my name.
Sal, can you do me a favor?
Can you pay me now?
Can't do.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
How much?  How much do I owe you?
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
Tina, you are too slick.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Shaddup, Vito.
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
I don't know.
I'll do that.
I was going to buy a slice.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
Hey!  Watch it.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Turn it off.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Oh my god, are you alright?
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Ooh gross.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
No, I'm fine thanks.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Home school? What's that?
Cool.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
Got any crazy eights?
Just a guy I hang out with.
Sounds like a pirate.
What?
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Shut up!
No.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
I don't know. Owwww.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
What?
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Sure I do. On one condition.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
You have beautiful eyes.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
No one knows?
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Right.
The one on the left.
Damn! What are the odds?
She's one of a kind.
You take her.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Oh, you're good.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
Special Needs class.
What are you doing here?
What?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
That's the downside. There is none.
Do we have a deal?
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
He passed away three years ago.
Will that be on the midterm?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
Wow, you are smart.
What papers?
JESSICA. Are you sure?
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
Things have been so serious here lately.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
No, but many consider my training valuable.
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Why do they come?
Liet?
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Where?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
It is my home.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
What's in the needle?
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
I don't know.  Where?
I've never seen anything like him!
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
What do you think you're doin'?!
Wow.
Will he be okay?
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Better than not getting a job?
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
I don't know.  It's so much money...
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
Goddamn landlord.
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
That's right...
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Yes?
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Lugosi?
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
"Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
How long's he been here?
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Huh?
Stop!
Uh, atomic energy?
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
You're sure this is gonna work?
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Isn't that the same thing?
What if--you're vomiting?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
What do you love her or something?
No.
I'm moving out.
What?!
You're nuts.
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
What if Shari's the dream?
This guy.
Who?
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Eddie? ...
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Yes.
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
St. Joseph's.
I can't?
Our what?
What are you doing?
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
I batted!
Cream rinse?
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
... yeah, then, but...
There's a list.
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
You know, that would be like a great thing.
What are you drunk?
I'm making a tape.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
I was in jail.
Hi.
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Ed?
How?
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Yo --
what?
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
Anything wrong?
Larry?
I know.
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
Why are you doing this?
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
I hope so
Could you get this? I can't
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
What do you want, Jim?
I was lonely.  You took advantage
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
And 290 "disregards," right?
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
Are you crazy?
Thought what?
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Yes, Paul?
How'd she meet Patchett?
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
Did you talk to Exley?
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
In the morning.
Call me Dudley.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
Let my daughter rest in peace.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Where are we going?
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
Let's just kill them.
You expecting problems?
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
Ellis Loew.
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Where are the police academy files?
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
Dogs got no reason to live.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Damnit...
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
Is she?
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Oh Jesus.
Someone else?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
When can you get it here?
Why?
Told by whom?
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
That's who they are.
Yes.
Yeah.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
Jesus!
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Jesus. Do you have proof?
<u>Here</u>?!
What the fuck?!
Gimme that.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
What if--
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Yes. I have her permission.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
About what?
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Somebody took my blender.
No, sir.
No.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
Just for the criminals.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
I saw a man die.
Yeah.
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
Robert--
I know.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
Good.
They're saying you killed that policeman.
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
I don't believe it is, no.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
And then what?
It is fish.
Do you like fish?
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
We're screwed.
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Good point.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Can I open 'em up?
Do I know you?
Usually they take clothes.
Can I talk to you a second?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
They're framing me.
Why would they--
I have a family.
Tell me about it.
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
Who?
No sir.
Do you have visual?
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Yes?
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Puffed cheese?
Hello!  Good morning.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
This is not very good, is it?
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
Will you not come in?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
What?  No!
I'm sorry, Katharine.
A broken car?
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Very well.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Or was it Toronto?
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Buon' giorno.
She can take you as far as Florence.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Is it you?  If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
Are you remembering more?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
I've been told that before.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
No!
I've met you before.
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
Why would anyone do this?
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
It's what I've learned.
Why Picton?
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
Then you were married?
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
How about if I try humility.
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
A film case.
We're going to die, aren't we...
Those are my clothes.
Only a week?
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
True enough.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
Won't take any time.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
What's that?
Charged.
So what are you going to do with your share?
The disc is still in there.
She's calling the shots now.
Thought you had to use some of these.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
250,000?
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
What's she doing here?
All of 'em?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
So you say.
How does someone get meningitis?
They did?
Five million dollars?
If you hadn't used profanity --
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
You never called me back.  I left messages.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
Yeah?
Where's Anna?
Out to lunch with the girls.
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
Erin --
Then I don't get anything either.
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
How many families we talking about here?
Is that what I think it is?
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
What do you mean?
I like this case.
Really?  It makes me sick.
What?  Who?
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
No one's taking anything --
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
I guess I did.
You're married.
There's more than one kind?
It happens all the time.
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
Thanks for reminding me.
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Yes, My Lord.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
He'll learn.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Because of my father, I guess.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
I think we're in trouble.
We?
And what are they, pray tell?
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
Now you're making sense.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
What are you staring at?
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
He found him in a junk pile ...
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
Thanks to you.
What about Han?
This hyperdrive had better work.
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
No!
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
We shall want a full autopsy ...
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
It's so good to see you again.
Don't lie to me.
Plissken...?
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
No way.
Who?
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
Well, I'll think it over.
When you threw it in, what did you see?
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
Excalibur! Is it true?
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
Father...
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
And you cannot love me...
Who?!
The law forbids it.
I will run.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
It is.
No, no, of course not. You are young...
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
It's-
Didn't who tell me?
Me too.
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
But it's clean?
A man to see you.
And those lies she's been telling?
Lies?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Never.
You're kidding! Like what?
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Did he tell you about my party?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
You wouldn't.
Oh yeah, since when?
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
To begin with it could make things worse.
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Are you sure?
Where's Regan's father?
In Europe.
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Yeah.
Captain who?
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
Oh my God!
St. Mike's.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Intensely.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
Ego te abslovo.
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Very much.
Who's in it?
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Are you a relative?
You're not going to drive.
It's our goddamn car!
Give me the keys.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Piano.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
So we on tomorrow night?
I hate your kids, Frank.
What do you think?
Says who?
What do you mean?
Terrific.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
I don't know what you mean.
No?
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
What's that?
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
Come on, stand still.
You hit me.
No.
Yeah.  Something.
Very realistic.
You leaving that on?
Doesn't it matter to you?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
Two hours ago!
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
Funny, huh?
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
No.
I don't know.
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Looks like these got a few years on them.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Charlie called.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Spur of the moment.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
The audience was a little off tonight.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Actually, that's my stage name.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Uh... he knows it.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
You're an hour and a half late.
So?
When?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
That!  You can't wear that!
I wear a seven.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
What do you think?
They're tight.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
Wow. You ever see her again?
Oh yeah?
What's with you two?
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Is that important?
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
He doesn't bite.
Baker.
He leads, I follow.
Every year.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
You were good.
Nina?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Soap convention.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Oh?
I guess it's getting serious.
How'd the show go?
Yeah?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Where am I?
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
I'm late for surgery.
How come?
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
One last time.  It's important ...
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Who is this?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
What are you going to do, Castor?
Stay away from my family!
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
What?
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
I'm just having some fun.
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
The hospital.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
I'm not going anywhere.
Oh, that Karl.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
Thats right. And auto supply...
No.
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
Wheres my real dad?
On a case by case basis...
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
You see, its like were in each others heads...
She is relentless.
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
You just said everyone needs something.
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  Youre making a business deal...
Why not?
Evelyn, right?
Something like that.
Are we...?
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Howd you do this year, Tony?
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
Are you okay?
What kind of man does that!?
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
Jack...
...my feet are hurtin...
Thanks, Jack...
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
Look, Im sorry.  Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now.  Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married...
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
Promise me again...
You look great.
Jack.
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
Its because Im shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Of course I did.
I'd like that, too.
Don't you have anywhere to go?
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
Five times.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Are you alright?
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
What do you want, Vic?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Front page?
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Ben's still out there --
But I'm not done with the machine --
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
For science.
Are you kidding?
What are you doing?
And reverse the mutations --
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Where do we stand?
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
It's only for an hour --
Yes, Alan.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Thank you for saving my life.
We can't take a second more.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
Yes...
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
How does it look, Doctor?
What about Dr. Michaels?
At an operation?
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Sort of.
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
What is it, Skipper?
Yes, there is.
Then don't drift down further.
The Wall's transparent...
Can I see your license and registration please?
Unguent.
One of us pays the other for half.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Huh?
Personal matters.
Three people. In Brainerd.
...The heck d'ya mean?
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Oh sure.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Uh-huh... A what?
In what way?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
You know what a disparity is?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Sir? Right now?
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Yah!
Yah.
Shep said 8:30.
Ya got the car?
Twice.
Are you calling Stan?
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
Yah.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
...What can I get ya?
...This is a nice place.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Nope.
Anyone else residing there?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
...Hello?
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Copy.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Not on your feet too much?
Yah.
Oh, my.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
You are a moron.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
You are?!
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
Hmm?
Dynamite?
Who do you think could've done this?
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Why are you doing this?
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
I'll take the parasites.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
When?
The Paper Street Soap Company.
He's not here.
Yeah?
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
You are an insane person.
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
Oh, yeah.
... You know me?
You were in here last Thursday night.
What?
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
What do you want me to do?
I mean -- for a living.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
What?
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Yeah.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
Okay... Ghandi.
You?
Yeah, I'm sure.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Okay.
Promise you won't.
Yes, I promise.
You get rid of her.
No thanks, I quit.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Something on your mind?
What should I have told you?
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
What are you doing?!
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
What are you talking about... ?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
What... what are you saying?
What about Marla?
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
You... you can't be serious about this.
I'm not going...
Yes...
One minute.
Why are you doing this?!
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Do something for me.
What?
His name is Robert Paulson!
Yes, it is.
Yesssss...
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
Maybe.  What's this about?
What's going on here?
Do you remember what triggered it all?
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
What is it?  What are you?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
This place?!
That... him?
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
Fag.
And don't pass on the right.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
I've seen worse places.
This place is a trip.
What's this stuff on the rice?
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Can you handle the door gun?
You're gonna love it.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
You think you are... .
Invulnerable.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
How long have you been setting up?
What's up?
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
What's your name?
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
Let's do it.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
Well, there's nobody special!
What?
No really..I can't.
No, I'm fine... really...
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
Remember. One chorus and out.
Come on now...You can't sit here.
I... I was just leaving.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Fine.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Yes.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
They're --  -- What?
The Little People?
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
Can I take you to lunch?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
You a fag too?
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
Divorced.
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
You just going to sit there?
Yes.
You treat me like I was.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
You're depressed that I come along.
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
Rayette.
Come on.
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
No substitutions.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
Am I on TV?
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Well, you seem very professional...
You know who it once belonged to?
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Robert...
I have to talk seriously with you...
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
Yeah... I guess so...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
It's none of your business!
I'm talking to you, Tita!
Hello...
I didn't have any.
None.
You think I'm a fake.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
No inner feeling.
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I have to talk to you.
Catherine...
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
That's three games to none, Carl.
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
It's a Borzoi.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Well, she was.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Aaron, how you doin'?
Fine.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
I, umm, came to see you.
So what you think of me?
How you treat them?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
Yeah.
A girl named Amanda.
Yo, that's my girl.
So what do you want with her anyway?
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Probably.  One of the many.
Jus' from around the way.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
This one's going to be even more fun.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Your aunt?
Well, which one?
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
Fletch...
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Good evening.
Check.
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Fletch?
What's that?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Why not?
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
I'm all ears.
So why pick me?
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Only if you promise not to return me.
Deal.
Not me.
My hero.
Cute young thing, too.
I'm sorry?
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
I really should change.
I saved his life during the war.
What about his parents?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
Who.
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
You shouldn't be here.
They just left, sir.
Cabana one.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Tell the cops.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Two...
I never read the paper.
What...
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Who?
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
You okay?
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
Hello?
Because I know rock-n-roll.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
I'm afraid so, you want her?
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Are you okay?
Did he just say what I think he said?
I'm sorry...
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
It doesn't have to be like this?
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
Did they follow you?
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Who's this --
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
It's beautiful.
You're in show business.
Suspicion of what?
What about Sal?
Forty dollars -- was $250.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
What is that old building?
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
You remember Mary Finelli?
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
You okay, man?
Butch called.
I'm off.
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
I know.  He loves that thing.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
Okay, start pedaling.
Queens, New York.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
What?
You just burned the desk.
It's really you, isn't it?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
When?
Something happened, something...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
Whatta you mean...
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
You really wanna know?
John, you still there?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
What...
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
So how are things at the hospital?
You work too hard, John.
What is that?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Will you come with me?
Come on down!
What's this?
A hammock?
Somebody was in here.
Shelly!  Where are you?!
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
My whole world.
What are we gonna do?
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Who's Horace?
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Did you hear me?!
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Boy scouting.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
So let's talk.
It's going.
Ed...
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
That's very colorful, chief.
For a good reason.
Does he know about what happened?
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
You don't know shit!
Look, I know I treated her bad --
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
He bought you that?
Tell me.
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
What are you doing in here?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
What are you doing??
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
Everything okay?
I can't swim.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
You have to call the police...
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Say it again.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
What was it like?
Do we care?
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
Shoot him.
What do you mean?
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
About what?
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
Why won't you tell me your name?
I'm willing to tell you my name.
Mystery. Deception.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
It's your best play, Nicky.
Opening night, Lillian.
That's always been my problem.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Life is true.
They're only gonna lose.
Let's not start that again.
I lost it. I lose everything.
So what are you going to do about it?
A grandmother. God bless you.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Because life is good.
This could be it!
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
I hate the Mets.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Yes.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
And he has finer moments now and then.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
So do I. Over and over.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I'm sorry.
I thought you were a man of God.
What do you want?
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Is it over if they arrest you now?
Do you find me stubborn?
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
The fools!  Sorry...
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
Have you read his magazine?
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
I like football.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
What a pity.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
Something's not right.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
What's wrong with him?
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
Who died?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
A day or so.
It's all right.
You really had other offers?
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
Everybody goes there.
Will you be okay?
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
I hope he's not just a body.
You worried about the cost?
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Let's walk.
My medication.  I left it back there.
I can't do this.
The name?  For the certificate.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
Yeah.
Assumed name... Houston.
Fatter... some things never change.
You were asleep.
Is he straight?
I couldn't have... much longer.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
Do you trust him?
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
I can handle it.
I'll bet you can.
We got this far.
You and me.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
No, I'm afraid not.
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
Aren't we going a little hard?
How's Mama and the kids?
He took the day off.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
You can't get away from me, Albert.
How?
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
What did you do?  Albert?
What's it got to do with you?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
I made a mistake.
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
Jack?
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Nicer than most.
Though nicer than most?
What?
Could you do me a favour?
You sure about that?
What girl?
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Thanks for coming.
Sorry about your father.
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
What?
Will this do?
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
What you going to do?
You're a bastard.
What, and get myself beaten up again?
What you going to do?
You coming back?
Jack Carter.
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
Making a living.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Yep.
Gerald wants to see him first.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
What's that?
...Polacks...
...they hold on to their money...
You did?
What?
You get a bad month, all of a...
I, I...I...
Shoes, boots, yes...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
For some sales pro...
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
With River Oaks?
What hard part?
Just the act.
You...
What do you mean?
How?
Yes.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
We're just "talking" about it.
What did you say?
Did you talk to Graff?
What did he say?
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Oh, yes, George.
...you don't have to come in...
Can we get some coffee...?
Fine.
Yes.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
They stole...
I was at home, where were you?
No, who?
Will you excuse...
You understand?
You...
Go to lunch, will you...
The leads come in, I'll let...
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Moss...Who told him?
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
Shelly...
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...no...
Of what?
And what if you don't close.
I'm not sure I have two.
Can't do it.
Is that what you're saying?
Get 'em to me!
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
It's not impossible.
Mmm.
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
How do you know I made it up?
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
The check's no good?
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
Fuck you, Dave...
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Twelve-fifteen.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Rick...?
Mm.
Yes.
I've got to talk to you.
Monday.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
I'm not.
When did you write the check?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
What is?
What's going on here?
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
We haven't got a lead...
Why not?
They took some of the con...
You did?
Yes.
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Three?  I count two.
Are you alright?
I got lots of presents.
We have no money for a rug.
What took so long?
The children can stay.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
I'm not afraid of his words.
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
Ready, Frankie.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
Within the compound will be fine.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
Hello?
Why didn't someone tell me!
Yes.
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
I took care of it.
Mike, at three and a half...
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
It might show.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
...and the tape will be running.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Sleeping inside me.
I had no idea...
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
On a plane back to Sicily.
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
Are you Klingman?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
We do favors for each other...
Enjoy.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
Let him gamble.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
I know.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
Rosato, where's your brother?
He don't want to talk?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
He supports me.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
What was that?
I accept your generosity...
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
Of course.  I am married still.
You're sure of that?
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
Good morning.
Nice place.
What?  Oh yes.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
No.  I'm fine.
I don't like to talk about that.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
So you had a wife?
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
Not fear.  More like disgust.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
A very lucky thing indeed.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
Do you mind?
Just take off the fucking mask!
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Then who did?
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
Yes.  Perfectly.
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Who was that at the door?
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Quite.
What rumors might those be?
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
It seems she neglected to mention it
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Jesus ...
You'll leave -- ?
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
It just ain't happening --
Yeah.
You ever feel bad about any of this?
Donny --
How's it going -- ?
Dignity...
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
We'll take it...
No...
Yeah ...
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Yeah -
Hey, you want something to eat ?
About what?
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
Hey, now -
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
You?
Me.
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
Dad'd be proud --
The era when crime didn't pay --
What?
What are you doing here?
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Mitch.
What kind of trouble -- ?
Six or seven...
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
Very good...
What the hell's that -- ?
Now... I'm in ...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
What are you doing... ?
What -- ?
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
You think it can be done?
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
Some crew you got ...
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
My bag. My bag.
It'll be okay.
With what?
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Where's the stuff?
You what?
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
What happened? You okay?
I got seared.
Keep 'em coming.
It's been six months.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I better call again.
It's a fait accompli?
You ready?
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
He's with his friends.
What kind of person doesn't call?
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
You want a partner?
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
When's the arraignment?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
Why not?
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
You and Morgan throw?
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
Hi.
I guess so.
I told you, I just got change.
I don't think I...Larry?
No, there's a limit.
Yeah, can I help you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
What're you doing?
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
That's right.
No.
It's right.  Take it home with you.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
I can come back.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Yes.
Find out what?
Good to meet you.
Sean.
My kind of background?
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
What should I do?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
You're getting defensive, Will.
You think so?
This is a real piece of shit.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
--Well, maybe that means you.
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
No.
Haven't called her.
Hence, the word remarried.
Yeah.
When did you know she was the one?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
It's not your fault.
Good for you. Congratulations.
You're Welcome, Will.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
Five minutes.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
So you just want to use me and go?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Why do we always stay here?
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
They don't come over here that much.
I know. I just do.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
I can't go out to California.
Is that what you think--
Take care.
Twenty days work, oh boy!
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Ready, Ma?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Don't hold me so tight.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Why, you're the preacher!
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
Is it fur?
I ain't gonna run.
What's the matter?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
You been acrost?
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Ma, you sick?
When?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
Got any more, Ma?
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
They killed Casy first.
They know what--this fella looks like?
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
I don't understan' it, Tom.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Well?
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
Now you done it! You busted it!
Yes I do.
You're so funny...
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
I just play my own collection.
That's it?
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
You see someone?
Are you going to the reunion?
Bad experiences.
Bad people.
What's that?
Yes.
Flowers. That's funny.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Hello, Bob.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Well?
I don't think so.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
And they want me to make up for it.
They were very upset.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Yeah...
Paul?
He sold me this bad boy.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
When I was first married.
I am comfortable.
Show me again.
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
No, you didn't.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Why? There's no food in the house?
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
I'll take care of it.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Yes. We're suing.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
What about Grace?
I'm sorry.
No, let me go.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
I love you.
How was the dinner?
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Everything all right.
How are you feeling about work?
Take your time.
You want to take a walk with me?
Where to?
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
I understand, but Annie, please...
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Of course not.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Yeah?
She's an editor.
That's not a question, is it?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
It's warmer than I thought.
No, not yet.
You just showing off for her!
Hey, darlin'.
You're looking fit.
How long were you married?
What stuff is that?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Yeah, cool.
Welcome to our show!
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Cereal.
Yeah?
Go fix the phones.
What are you doing?
That's bullshit.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
I know, I know who wrote it.
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
Dade.
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Good.
You're welcome.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Joey, Joey...
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
Thank you.
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
I don't know Brady.
What does that mean?
Get back!
Brady!
Brady!
When did this happen?
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
About what?
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Night Doc.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Double scoops?
What?
I can't.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Its not over yet.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Its true, Sheriff.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Where's that Deputy?
Car trouble?
Now you understand?
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Well, are we still on for tonight?
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Why did you hang up on me?
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
I wasn't spooked.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
We're all alone, aren't we?
I gotta go.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
Where?
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Can we watch the monster movies?
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
I don't like that story.
Laurie...
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
There was no one outside.
Yes.
Laurie, you come with us...
Let's make more popcorn.
Of course not.
What did you use before?
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Hi.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
What?
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
We--
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Oh, what, in this section of town?
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Bye.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Elliot!
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
Mm-hm?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Was I?
I want one with you.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
So?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Hmm?
Because I have to!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
But you don't have any symptoms!
It was on your shirt!
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Yeah.  What?
Doesn't she look pretty?
I got two minutes.
Huh?
He's fine.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Thanks, thanks.
This is the second opinion.
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
You promised to stay on the wagon.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Uh-huh.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Boy--
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
You treat me like a loser.
Hmm!
What's the matter?
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Have you?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Really?
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Oh, God!
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
...read it over, and think about it.
I can't think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
...how are things at the Hospital?
What have they got you doing?
...very good.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
You want me to be?
Who would that be.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
What else did I miss...?
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
He don't like popcorn.
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
...here's to child abuse!
Mmm...
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
...standard issue...
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
...your <u>scar</u>..?
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
The girl needs help.
...might I make a suggestion...?
What's that, Baby?
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Why?
...and that is what you need to expand.
Hello....?
...what did you want? 
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
...what a lovely perfume.
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
I don't understand.
Yes.
...yes...?
Yes.
...why?
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Because?
No.
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Man, she's losing it...
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
Do you really not believe in God?
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
You stupid cunt!
Where did you get these?
What do you want from me?
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
Perrier water!
Kurt doesn't look too good.
We killed them, didn't we?
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Cool off, we're seniors.
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
I guess.
That's three things.
Look who I've found!
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
Can I go now?
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
She's terribly hurt . . .
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
This.
What?
You'll never guess what's happened!!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Let's go overseas . . .
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
I'm stumped.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Must be nice.
What?
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
What's wrong, Trev?
That was cold...
What?
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Really, why's that?
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Do you know where you are?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Last week...
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
You got a drinking problem or what?
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
It's November.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
I...
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
That's not what I mean...
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
What's the matter?
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
You didn't?
Safety?
So this really does the trick, eh?
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
About us.
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
And?
Here, take this out to the table.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
He doesn't have a temperature.
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
We're going to think about it.
What?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
The cab's waiting!
Philip!  The senior partner?
That's not the case.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
He had to come from somewhere.
I think it was England.
When did you get back?
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
I'm sure they will.
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
How long is the voyage?
No.  What am I to do?
No -- I will.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
Your life.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
Are you a cop?
Because it's my name.
Yes.
Why?
You're not an easy person to get to know.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
It will end tonight.
He's in there!
Be careful, Conner.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
You know it's not safe here for you.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
Talley.
What'd you find out?
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
What do you want to do?
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
I guess not.
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
Bullshit!
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
What about my father?
We can take it with us.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
Can you identify this man?
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
I'm scared shitless.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
What?
You gotta pee?
Is something wrong with Jane?
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
I think so.
He has lots of disks.
Where are my children?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
How many in your family?
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
Anything. Strong.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
You said you had no whiskey.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
When?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
You are a marked man.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
I committed no war crimes.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Business is good at the hotel?
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
Very soon.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Promoted. House Manager.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
You are the manager?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
That will take time.
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Move? Where to?
Let's have dinner first.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Do something.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
Oh, my God!
How can we help him.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
You cannot go alone.
What does it matter.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
Please do not talk like this.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
All. What do you mean all?
What is his room number?
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
So what stopped her?
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
-- closed.
Why?
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
There's always exceptions.
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- you lose either way, Price --
Run.
You okay?
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
-- what...are...you...going...to --
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
Vannacutt!!
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Excuse me?
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
Why?
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
I just, I don't know...
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
What the hell is that?
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Oh come on!
She's gone!
Are you all right?
You must be a Londrigan.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Your daughter's been taken.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
What?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
And what is ... this frozen moment?
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
What is it?
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
What?
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Buying some drugs, alright?
Joey ... ?
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
Welcome. 38
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
What ... What ... ?
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Oh, I don't ...
Eighth room down, babe...
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
You got about five minutes and change.
Alex, are you....
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Hit me with your best shot.
I'm going to find out.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
That's what you theenk.
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
Oh, you read that.
I was the Warden?
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Oh Hudson...
I hope you know what....
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
Cat got his tongue?
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
The Hoopsucker!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
I'm happy enough.
...Hello?
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
He didn't offer you money.
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
You're from Muncie?!
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
...What happened?
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Norville!
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
...Geez.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
...Why, this is worthless.
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
Wuddya mean, buddy?
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
...Yeah, go ahead.
Well, I made the dean's list.
Not even behind your back?
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Finally.
Maybe he's wise.
Hello, Niagara.
...Her mother needs an operation...
...adenoids.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
You're single?
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
It's my day off.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Well?
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Wesley!
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Investigation of what?
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Got a meeting uptown.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
It's a starting place.
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
That this was going to be a key party?
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
I'm fine dad.
Fine.
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Your toes cold?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
With Mikey?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
I suppose. Why?
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
I don't like coffee.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
How'd you know?
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Now you are being rude.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
How can you do that man?
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
No candy for me?
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
The Idiot?
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
You have to follow me?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
With who?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
Communist Viet Cong.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
So far.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
No.
That's right.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
Randy Stetz?
Are you sure about that?
To do nothing.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
Did you love her?
The other guy?
That's a long time.
Hey...
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
Down at the station?
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Yes.
What the hell do you know?
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Where's your back-up?
Then there is nothing.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
Yes... My God...
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
I couldn't prevent it.
Your melancholy eyes...
I didn't realise.
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Why does he call you that?
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
Yes.
Or her, or her - or any of them?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
You know her?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
You really want to be with them?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Dear God, what have I done?
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
Why do you do this Lestat?
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
You followed me here, didn't you?
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
Can a vampire feel love?
No... it can't end like that...
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
Your what?
There's nothing between Will and me.
That could break the machine.
The number's unlisted...
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
Cancer in a box.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
Oh, god, it's you --
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
I understand something.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
I love it here.
Don't kill me --
I'm okay.
You sure it's okay with you?
Why are you doing this to me?
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Well, I'm in school and --
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Rio de Janeiro!
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Cool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
How's the water?
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
Drunk again?
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
What are you doing?
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are  a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
What would I be thinking?
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
What if he is?
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man   working at him   turning him against Thea.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
Go through with what?
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
No.
Made what?
You sent for me, sir?
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
It will?
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
What's that?
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
She's swell.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
You're not paid to be a canary.
Anything I can do back here?
Aw, forget it.
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
I know it's soon to talk about it.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Say hello to New York for me.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Holy mackerel!
Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
I'd like to do that.
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
In that place?
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
Tuesday.
Do you like it?
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Don't you like her?
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
To keep from being an old maid.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
Is it snowing?
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Oh, George, George!
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Your dad must be really pissed.
Why'd they decide to move?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
Mike's out there.
Untie that rope.
Where to?
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
Yeah?
Hey, come on....
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Mrs. Silvera?
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Careful.  What's wrong?
What?
What'd I say?
I know you did....
What're you doing?
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Two of them are still missing!
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Some people.
Hi Dad.
Waiting for Andy.
Get a dance yet?
Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.
Just like this.
Until we find something.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
I'm not sure I can.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
Who wouldn't.
Eat Cheerios.
Be reasonable, please....
Go on, you're tired.
You buying?
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Who's going to do it?
I want that shark, Kathryn.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
No!
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
A piece of pie on Sunday.
I think they'll come out now.
Give me a ride?
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Depends on big brother.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Besides that.
Ahhh, ahhh...
That?
Thanks.  Bullshot.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
How far away is filter number four?
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
We're in love.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
No way....
We need beer....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
How come it's my responsibility?
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
Henny Youngman....
They won't kill it....
We don't want any....
The fish.  Check it....
I like Grandma's cooking....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
You're damn right I'm serious....
How are you doing?
I'm not going to quit now....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
I have to get this finished.
There's nothing to worry about....
It got him....
No....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
I can't....
What's wrong?
They had them on the big one....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
Yeah....
How many...?
You tagging them...?
How many?
Stop busting my hump....
Where is everybody?
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
How long have you known Hoagie?
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
Who?
Hoagie.
I am...You must know something about him....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
What about Carla's gig?
I'm going down, Jake....
You getting a reading on them?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
How come only me?
'A Moray eel....'
Shit....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Your equipment has crapped out again....
I'll do it, Jake.
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
Here it comes....
She's in management....
Is it your vehicle?
Be my guest. What you got?
Yeah, he can go ...
Who is who?
Not for me ..
How's the new residence?
Not too good in daylight ..
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
We're going.
Then give me that Zippo.
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
Well .. I didn't know that ..
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
I dunno what I can do to help you?
What is that?
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
Is this normal?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
You must have some idea about him.
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
No.
Are you married?
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
I know what you're like ..
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
I have to talk to you, Helena.
I know.
Why does he want to kill me?
I know about alcohol, John.
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Yeah, I guess I do.
What was she like?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
He's happy, darlin ..
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
That's right.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
Well, no you didn't --
This can't be happening to me.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
Oh tsht. Yes.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Thanks.
Too bad.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Well -- this would be goodnight.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Why do you love me?
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
He's coming over.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
I got it.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Huh?
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
You're telling me to dance.
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
We still having dinner in L.A.?
I have to ask.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
How sad --
I'll go back to them.
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
... dick?
Jerry --
What's going on, Jerry?
Show me the animal, Jerry!
I'm scared.  What is it?
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Do you think it goes all the way across?
You look good.
Nothing.
No, it's...
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
They couldnt climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
How would you classify it?
They never got that big.
Raptors, mostly.
Eric, your parents are both here.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
You hear something?
You are an academic.
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
I could come with you.
Dad!
Okay.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
There' no reason for name calling.
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Are you insane?!
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
You think this is all a joke?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Where's Kelly?
We have to send someone to look for him!
Ask her.
You're sure we have to?
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
Carousel.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
Constantly sick.
- - barfs them up - -
Are you sure?
Alan?!
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
And scary.
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
Dino droppings?
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Why not?
Yeah.
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
Listen, ahh - -
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
I doubt it.
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
I can't!  I'm scared!
The kids okay?
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
For today, I guarantee it.
All night?
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
Don't do that!
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
We miss you.
They don't bother me.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Hello?
No, but...
You have a map.
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
I really think we should go back...
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Sorry.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
Cute waitresses?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
See this?
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
And if he's not?
What's that?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Have you worked here long?
You work in the cemetery.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
No, I left it in his office.
You're detestable.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
Are you free tonight?
And you ...?
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
Gabriela ...?
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
No -- not this time.
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
What did she say?
Do you?
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
... A piece of paper ...
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
It usually is.
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Orlac is an account?
I could always apply there.
Ludwig.
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Father!
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
There's a light up ahead.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Man Eater!!!
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
They were just tasting the berries.
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
What about him? Yes.
Uh uh.
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
No.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Yes.
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
What're you gonna do next?
Thanks.
Arlyn Page.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
How can you do it to yourself?
No.
We did this before.
You and I -- a relationship.
Go down in my room.
You're going back?
What?
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Have you discussed this with them?
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
I think she's trying that.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Are you closing the case?
Yes?
The prospect of losing my child.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Ladies and gentlemen...
You're late.
I'm sorry.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Then eat around it.
Sleep tight.
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Did mommy ever see this?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Uh, huh?
What don't you understand, pal?
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Objection!
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Objection!
Yes...
And how did you find his work?
No.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
I don't know, Jim...
What the hell is this?
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
And?
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
And?
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
It's going to cost.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
No, but--
Look, Ted, all I--
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
Yes, Holiness.
Not the way to talk to people.
I do, now.
Are you, General?
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
I have.
I am afraid.
Your father had been very sick.
Cow.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
Do I have money?
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
Good day.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
You have grown up very good.
Tell me.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
Like my mother.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
We are here on official business.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
I do <u>not</u> like you.
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
What's that?
I can arrest you!!
No!
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
Where is he?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
You take care.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
Such the flirt.
Eh.  Fuck it.
What?
In Maine?
I beg your pardon?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
You flew up here because your boss--
That was an awful thing to say to me.
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
You okay?  Kelly?
That's probably good.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Who taught you be be a nurse?
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
Well.  Goodnight.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
White perch.
You said nobody came in here!
Now I'm gonna puke.
Did he say anything?
Yes.
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
I thought I saw...
Hey!!
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
What is this?
Are you okay?
Should I?
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
Kevin told me you were upset.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
Liar?
Why not?
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Get me out!
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
Starling -
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Yes sir.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
What do you see, Starling?
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
Yes.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
Was it a butterfly?
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
I - ran away...
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
Can we rest soon?
What?!
The Ottawa are gone.
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Sorry to disappoint you...
What is it?
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
There was no letter.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
Yes. Go ahead.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
That is sedition! Treason!
We don't.
I don't understand!
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
Got a reason to stay.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
Sir!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Yes.
This interview's over! The militia stays!
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
We're getting out of here just in time.
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
How do you know it was Williams?
How's astronaut training?
The internal monitors read normal.
Where's Doc?!
No!
How do you feel, DeJesus?
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
You read Russian?
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
Getting some food.
I'm going to try to remove it.
What is it?
Who were you talking to?
How is he?
What on earth's the matter with you?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
Your pocket?
Hardly.
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
Well?
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
It's a Samoan pub.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
How long has he been in there, son?
Yeah?
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Is there no way they can get back to you?
There is only three of us here.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Why, what's up?
Right as rain.
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
You got it all?
I like your bar.
Yes?
And that does include the amp?
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
What have you come as?
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Tom, you're all heart.
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
I can't take any more school.
Well?
You're dismissed, Private.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
I hear they're closing that post down.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
A .45--
So is Buddy on your short list?
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
You look good--
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
My mother said he never asked about--
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
Well--
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
This place is a gold mine.
Right.
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
Seriously.
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Pleased to meet you.
If the next guy's a redneck.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
Right.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Is very beautiful, your car.
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
That's a matter of interpretation--
That so?
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
You go by your old house?
No.
Bledso
He still living?
Besides my father, I mean.
Morning, Hollis.
I got an idea what happened.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
There must have been somebody.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
And my father?
It's Saturday.
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Yeah.
I'm going over to the other side.
Gotta be in person.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Yeah. It's quiet--
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
I could have lost my fucking hands.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Right.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
You don't?
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Are they treating you okay?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Harry?
Valentin?
Good.  There.  Yes?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
... they believe you.
What were you doing up there?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
They weren't worth a damn.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Are you a gambling man?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
What's her problem?
Not much.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
Have you been in?
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
Oh Jeez.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
And he didn't have them?
No.
Yes.
What about Philip Swann?
Bob, it's me.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
What about you? Why are you here?
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Philosophy.
Not really. How long are you here for?
I don't want to go home.
Charlotte, who?
Really?
Did I scowl at you?
Ok, whatever you want.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
Where'd you grow up?
John thinks I'm so snotty.
You are.
Do you ever see him?
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
Hi, Bob.
Mr. Harris?
Is there anything I can do?
Like Japanese food.
You smell weird.
See you later.
Its bad for you.
Uh...sure...I...what?
I spaced out.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
What time did you make it for?
And how would you describe him?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
You just call?
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Why did he try to kill me?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
What do you mean?
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
What are these?
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
What do you mean by that?
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Need any help?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
There you go.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
That's not it.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
That's ridiculous.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
What?
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
You could make a career by telling me where.
It's okay.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
Mom tell you to do this?
This brother from my college.
Too many times.
What's up with that?
I know.
He works at a bank.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
I want to ride my own bike.
So?
So she's honest.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
God, here we go.
With a jacked-up attitude.
I don't.
Hey.
You having fun?
When'd you get this?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
What'd it say?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Give me the ball.
Why not?
Nobody.
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
I never asked you to choose.
I don't think so.
When did you decide all this?
Just something I'm trying.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
A rest?
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
You asked me what was missing.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
What?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
Hey, girl.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
We should head over.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Uh, your earring?
Why not?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You came out early.
I just told you.
Sorry.
We need to talk.
Came by to check on you.
No.
Yeah.
What surery?
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
It's a helluva disease.
Your mother wants to hear from you --
...yeah...
For what?
No.
You just move in here?
got some coffee brewing, huh?
-- do you wanna cup?
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
It's not -- what's a 422?
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Really?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
Well.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
-- you the resident here?
You live alone?
Have you ever been there?
What happend, what's going on?
Son, please, now....
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
No Can Do.
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.

Doc it's Janet.
What happend?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Is it real love?
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
Mmm.Hmm.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
No.
Is this 509-9027?
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
All it takes is one second?
-- let's talk more about your background --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
Go ahead and waste your time.
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
Where are you from originally?
the valley?
Why does that sound silly?
Does you mother still work?
She's retired.
She's my mother.
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Kind of.
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
When did he go off chemo?
Calm down.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Did your wife find out?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
Yeah. Yes.
I'm sorry.
What were you saying, Stanley?
Slowly or quickly?
I love you.
How do we do this, then?
I'm a bad person.
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
Just once.
How long with Paula?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
Did you ever touch her?
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
You're her boyfriend?
They look pretty smart, I think.
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
Where will the money go?
What are you doing?
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
mmm.hmm.
Bottled Water?
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
We need more dog food --
Be ready at two --
Stand up.
Hi.
I have money.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
He is your brother!
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
What are they doing?
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
The Prison of Belle Sur.
A body.
He who is not with us is against us.
And people close to him, who --
More wine!!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
You can do it.
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
Pull them back!
There are more important things than tits.
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
We go someplace dangerous.
What do we do now?
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
What is its antidote?
Your Majesty...
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
... Two-thirty-seven.
Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
Magnificent valor...
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
What's this?
Gotta come from somewhere...
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
What?  Wait a minute -
Where is he?!!
Captain?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
Yeah.
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Holy shit -
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
Both at the same bank...
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
Not the Bible?
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
Wait, Will...
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
What's it narrow down to?
'Changes?'
There's no connection between the families.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
The activities of nocturnal animals.
Reba...
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
Who?
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
You'll let me go now?
Come in.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
I don't think I'll tell you.
What about the dog?
What did he want?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
No.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Will?  You could come up here.
Yes. Who are you?
How did it happen?
Huh?
No.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Yes, I thought so.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
What were the yards like?
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Tank you veddy much.
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
George, I hate sitcoms.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
So who's gonna pay for it?
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Popcorn?
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
You're not listening to me --
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
Goals are important.
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
Sure...
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
Don't be ridiculous.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Just get me outta here.
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Who's coming for me?
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
What are you doing?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
You -- you're too fast.
Do you know why you didn't make it?
I think I do.
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
She helped you?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
What do you believe in?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
What?
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
What are you doing?
I'm coming with you.
Can you fly that thing.
Where is it?
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Neo, this has to be done!
You're not far from Cypher.
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Well the guy over there said...
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
You flew before?
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
Panther!  Same thing...
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
There won't be any this week.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
No...I'll be ok for a week.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
Michael, give us a lift.
Out!!!!
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
Charlie, this is business.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Please take it.
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
Sure...He lives there?
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
Count it.
I know...I know.
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
I know you do, darling.
From the Korean War.
Of course.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
Who's Annie?
I don't like cake.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Here...
Of whom?
It doesn't matter.
I'm not stepping anywhere --
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
It's going to be great --
Like a marriage made in heaven?
As close as a deal could be.
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what he said.
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
I from dat nex' place.
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
Good morning, Jennifer.
You think so?  How do you know?
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
She's in a great deal of pain.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
It comforts you, doesn't it?
Has her pain abated?
Girlfriend?
I'm sorry about --
Yes?
I don't know who you are.
He's taking a nap.
Will it?
The 'coffee shop' --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
That's it?
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
'Threw' you?  Where?
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
How long have I got?
How about giving a guy a break?
Yes.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
I don't know.
You were just curious?
You tell me, Bill.
That's okay.
What's okay?
Yes, I saw you see me.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
'Spooning'?
This universe?
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
You are?
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
So that's what love is?
I didn't ask any question.
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
'The one' to do what?
What the hell are you talking about?
The 'question' --
Hi, Bill --
Good morning, Quince.
I am, this is it.  B Day.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Good morning, Dad.
Drew told me.
Does Drew tell you everything?
Not my birthday again?
Don't get carried away.
What were you going to say?
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
We've met.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
This is crazy --
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
Why not?
You said you liked me.
69.
Well, what then?
Condition?
What makes you think he's my friend?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
This isn't my room?
When was I in here?
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
That's right I did, didn't I?
A cop?
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
Jimmy?
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
How do I know he did that to you?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
What do the police think?
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Calls himself Dodd.
What does he want?
Help me.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
I don't know. I'm sorry.
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
Yup?
Who?
Why?
You don't know him?
We've got to get him out of here.
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Why?
I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
No. You took them out.						  *
Why would I do that?						    *
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
Doing...?
Sal Maguda.
He any good?
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Two main players plus three.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
You do.
When?
Where's that?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Is this the protective male talk?
No part of it wasn't real.
Yeah.
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
No.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
What's your take?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
What are you talking about?
On the phone.
They had me from the gate.
So?
You sure?
...and thanks for the flowers.
You mean with the flowers...?
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Lotta rich women back there...
Men, they mostly faggots.
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
For money.
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
You got a comb?
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Hell, don't cry about it!
Here. Don't even thank me.
Get outta my way.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Yessir, I can see that.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Ready for anything.
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Getchmis olsun
What?
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Sixty Lira?
Where are the minefields?
Yes.  I think so.
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Just what?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Beats working.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
Just Erich.
Feeling all right?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
He wasn't even in the car?
And?
Okay?
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
What?
Why the suit?
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
H-how do I get...?
And a right.
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
Is there a switch?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
What-
Peter-
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
What are they...?
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
You want to read it?
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
Nothing.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
I don't know.
Set what up?
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
I can't write this anymore.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
I'm telling you, I can't.
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
You really think Sheldon's out there?
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
Maybe you can, Libby.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
No, the typing kind.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
All done, chief..
From her point of view or mine?
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
Your room.
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
What you got there, mate?
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
Would you mind if I'm on top?
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
They've got a book for this?
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
Before you are.
Just like old times.
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Very.
Yes, I believe that's right.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
Yes, I gathered as much.
I do.
..I'm fine..and you?
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Now how to get in there.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
So what do you suggest?
You knew about Jim?
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
Take off your coat.
Where were you?
You're sure about this?
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
I didn't say that.
We did what we had to do.
Go ahead.
Youíre in Prague?
I don't quite follow you.
The arms dealer.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
Certainly Ethan.
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
On what?
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Claire.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
I thought I was going to see Max.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Why not?
He's our guy.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.
That's what we do isn't it?
Cosmo?
Yes.
I don't know what you mean.
You're not sleepy?
Yeah.
He got hit by a bus.
Mona?
Excuse me.
He knew my husband who died.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Why you talking to me?
She was right to leave me.
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
I was dead.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
What about Johnny?
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
It's so bright.
I've never seen a moon like that.
I'm marrying your brother!
I'm telling you you can't.
You've gotta get outta here.
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
I shouldn't.
On the floor?
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Alright. A month. In a month.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
No.
Why not?
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
A wife knows.
Where's pop?
Hi.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
That's a pretty big sin.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
He should pay.
I don't know.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
That's incredible.
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
Sorry. That was rude.
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
May I walk with you a ways?
I'm too old for you.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
Rita. Rita.
What? What?
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
No one live there.
NI!   NI!
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Are you sure he's got one?
Now what happens?
Ni!
There!  Look!
A G...g...g...
Look, you're a busy man ...
There.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Old woman!
I'm thirty-seven.
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
I'm getting better!
I feel fine.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
What is the capital of Assyria?
Bring out your dead!
Farewell, Concorde!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Do you want to come and have a drink?
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Who are you?
Leaving the room ... yes.
Right.
Yes ...  make sure ...
Brave, Sir Rob ...
How much?
Sixty.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
And she sent no word down?
I've got my duties to attend to.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
You watch your tongue.
You know nothing about her!
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
Checked and locked, sir.
A situation?
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
Gesture?
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
Do you?
Occasionally.
You sent for me.
It's nothing.
Was there never ambition?
Maybe, once.
So...?
They aren't as watchful as you.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
And the pony?
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Who by?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
Must they always follow us?
Is that not enough?
This is my good John Brown.
The question is, do we need her?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
You can't know that for sure.
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
I have a letter, ma'am.
Maybe he's not dead.
He?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
We are talking...
It's twelve-thirty!
So how did it know my name, then?
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
Our time's up.
I'm okay.
Go for it.
So how do I start?
Give her a chance, will you?
I'm going home Cynthia.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
But I'm not broke.
You gotta be kidding?
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
Howdy!
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
Wow!
Your Aunt called me.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
There was an accident. I came here.
No, no, I'm fine.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Diane?
But, this could be serious.
What's wrong?
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
I'm not sure about this.
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
Those men in front, in the car.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Not here...no thanks.
So what do we do ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
Why did you build this whole place ?
He hired you to build this place ?
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
This is cute.
Do you know where you're going ?
What about you ?
That was eleven years ago.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
I thought you made this place ?
What the fuck are you talking about.
Knock yourself out.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
What's wrong ?
So ?
I am thirty two.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Sir ?
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
No I am not.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
We can't afford too many surprises.
Will he make it out ?
Maybe you should get over fears.
Thank you very much.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
Shut up ! It's me.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
Good morning.
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
You had to remind me?
Are you writing a poem?
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
THANK YOU.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Seriously.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
Of course.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Can I see him?
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
Never heard of him. 
No.
Sure am, who are you?
I told you it was a long story.
And she saved it.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
Just give it to me!!
It's dangerous!!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
What's it for?
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
You're a good man Nicholas.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Maybe.
A secret, I like that.
This is it I guess.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
I think this place is just fine.
You know how I feel about you.
Well maybe for you.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Good for you baby.
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Keep your voice down!
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Can't you see it?
Uhh, Miss devoto...
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
It's nice.
No, why?
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Rock?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Yes.
Goodnight Shelly.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
I love this guy! 
Hi.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
Why not?
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Really?
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
For this class?
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
Cause she's dying.
He likes her.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
He's allergic to everything.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Uh huh.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Well he just left, what's wrong?
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
Oh great!
I knew he wouldn't come.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
What?
Who's that with your Dad?
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
THIS!! 
So?
Come on, let's go.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
I do, she's real funny.
Leave then, some friend you are.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Like they do on TV?
Okay, okay.
For what?
I should look different.
You don't miss much.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
Blood oath.
We'll never be the same.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Try less appropriate.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
I was gonna predict that.
Ju...
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
But he always says...
Uh, Kimmy...?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
I saw the show.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
W...
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
She finds him "personable."
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
Oh, yeah.
I never forgot that.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
... I'm partial to the tight end.
Maybe it's happy there.
Right here.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
You're from out of town?
Don't feel that way, honey.
You have to what?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
How did you come in here?
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
She's going to rest now.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
He has that sign with the tree.
You know better than that.
What's he running for?
Yes, but we're just singing.
Howdy.
Come on. He's a crook.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
What is a turkey shoot.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
Mom?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
No, I don't.
Who is this?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Yes.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Hello.
Who is this?  It's Tom.
I've got a gig tonight.
I knew when I first met you.
Thirty?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Hundreds of times.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
Sorry I'm late.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
How long have you been together?
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
He ain't really new.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You want a ride into town?
Got me an audition tonight.
You think I should take lessons?
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
That's what Tim said.
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
What did you think then?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
By all means.
Who's the song bird?
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
How come you never talk?
She was born without a tongue.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
All right, Mickey.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Just wait one fucking minute.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
I admire them.
Only on a much grander scale.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
Rockin'!
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
How 'bout Mallory?
How so?
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
All right, you get out of here, man!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
I been sendin' her money.
Like where?
Name's Duff.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Yeah, I been there.
Went to college, huh?
Yes, aren't you?
That's right.
No.
How about another beer?
That's right.
Let's go, Duff.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
What d'you mean?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
'Been up north?
No.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Okay, I guess.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Hmmm - good coffee.
You didn't answer my question.
Huh?
Don't, Duff.
About ten dollars.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
I'm trying to help, Duff.
What the hell could you do?
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Where're you going to go?
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
What 'you signifyin'?
What happened?
Better get him to a hospital.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
Who is?!
How are you?
I guess I ain't.
I doubt it.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Let's go.
Omar--
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
Since when?
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Easy...
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
Yeah, well it's working.
What are you talking about?
An odd selection, Mr Case.
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
Where the hell have you been?
How much time you got left?
You're late.
Case.
I thought you already left.
Where did you here that?
I had to limit your options.
What about before that?
Too late?
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Case... Are you alright?
Petty good.
What is with this school and prom?
Right. 7:30.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
Now this is cute.
Hi!
You need my help?
Wings?
Transitioned?
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
It was a long time ago -
Josie Grossie.
Better than I...
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
Boys.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Our penguin, right?
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Wow - I-
He <u>has</u> to know...
Yes.
Just what?
Taste it.
Uh-huh.
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
What the hell are you talking about?
Who told you to choke up that way?
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
What are you doing here?
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
What is this place?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
About what?
What's so funny?
Jess?
Hi, Kerry.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
Good morning, Jennifer.
I gotta stay up, Max.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
You need me, I'll be here all night.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
Anything?
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
I can't believe I just did that.
Doesn't matter.
Then maybe you're ready.
For what?
The truth.
We can try again.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
We've got work to do.
I could've saved them.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
How is he?
I won't allow it.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
I'm a vegetarian.
Lovely to meet you.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
You've got to go.
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
With a goat playing a violin.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Oh please sod off.
Okay.
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Stay forever.
This is certainly... ah...
You disappeared.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
Sorry about that.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
What's your name?
What does it say?
He's bringing a girl?
Does the girl have a name?
He wouldn't say.
Yes -- sort of...
Bernie -- this is Anna.
And we intend to use them!
Da Vinci?
Di Caprio.
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
So I get the brownie?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Does she know you're coming?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Hey.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Excuse me.
Yes, that is correct.
Who? Tell me!
Yes, ma'am...
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
Yes, ma'am...
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah?
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
That's okay, kid...
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Marry who?
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Yeah, where we going?
Yeah, my feet are cold...
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
He can't hear you!
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
No!
No!
Gimme a cigarette!
Why not?
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
'Kay!
Are you a doctor?
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
How do ya know that?
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Please follow me.
Hi.
Big man!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Bet you ass...
What happened?
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
He's dead.
You ol' fucker!
Your grandmother?
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
We'll KNOW.
But, Faith--
Congratulations.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
How could you do this to me?
Uh, I'd rather not say.
I'm sorry.
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Beautiful place...
Well, not exactly...
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Excuse me?
No.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
So?...
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
I know.  You're right.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Does Dwayne know about this?
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
What'd you find?
'Course he does.
That was a long time ago.
Larry bought himself cologne?
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Why?
No.  No, you go ahead.
Amazing...
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
Kate.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
What?  You know him?
I came after the woman I love.
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's 
Mmhmmm.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
I'll get home all right now.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Listen, you like beer?
How about another one?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and  I had to take a few dives.
What made you want to be a fighter?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
What for?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, no, no... .
Get out of my way.
Well, it's over.
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
I don't want to hear it in there.
But you've got to listen to me.
A question of who rides who.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Never will be much too soon.
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
I'm just resting my feet.
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys 
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under   whop-whop!
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
Give me a double.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
Listen, Johnny
I was only talkin' to her.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
Go on, beat it!
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Maybe I will one of these days.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
Something's making that music.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
The time...is short.
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
No. No! No!
I could make her another Cleopatra...
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Ask him his name.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
You were his what, his box?
I don't know where he is.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
I'm a tourist.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
How long you talk to her?
Now that's a really big house.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
We made it, didn't we?
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
All right, but...
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Hello?
Karen, I told you not to--
How much for your company at chow?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
I thought so, too.
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
You won't do that.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
I don't think we should get into that.
You just did, for Christ sake.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
Of course not.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
Meaning?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
You like to sit down?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
No?
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
You gonna go get him?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Red...Strange?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
You liked that?
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Didn't you say test the limits?
How could you do this?
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
They're all over us!
You hear my okay?
Maybe just trying to measure up.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
How's everything?
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
Sorry to trouble you.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
How did you?...
What else can we do?
Brilliant, Admiral.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
Have the planes made it to China?
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Where is it?
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
You got a Tab?
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
Yeah. Like that.
Where did you get that sweater?
He's trying.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
What?
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I've got to go now.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Terry, slow down.
Terry! Slow down.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Coffee and a donut.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
I can't do that.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
All right. But this better be good.
I closed my Christmas club.
This morning was good.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
He'll win.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
How do you feel?
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
What are you doing?
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
Sort of.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
I	know what a burrito is.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
What're you doing?
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Richard, take it easy.
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
Jesus.
Why, Beckett?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
Ready for what, baby?
Take it easy, Walter.
About my blood work?
Innocuous?
Continue.
They sabotaged me.
Who'd you get?
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
You think I'm uncomfortable...
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
I've considered that.
We proceed, representing your estate.
Are you a good lawyer?
Yes. On my torso.
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
What can I do?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Yes.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
What's Dr. Gillman say?
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Who?
Don't know, Joe.
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Yes, we did.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Oh, Lord....
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
They're coming.
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Better keep moving....
So why isn't it all bloody?
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
79 kilos.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
What?
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
Very big beads.
Say that again.
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
Not a star-jumper.
Take it.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Do you have any weapons?
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
What are you doing there?
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
'Then how do you account for me?,
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
How did it go?
Yo!
No.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Hmph.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
What?
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Shhhh!
Taylor! Tell him.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
He doesn't know.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
So what's the problem?
Yeah, what is it?
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Taylor! Francis!
But what'd she actually do?
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
Whew! - where that come from?
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
These two holes are yours...
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't know.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
I think I'd like to dance.
How careful should I be?
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
What did you say his name was?
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
And do you amuse the guests?
Whatever you say.
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
What time is it?
Quarter after one. Why?
Cold?
I didn't notice him.
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
You-killed-him?
Mitchell was dead enough.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Is it a crime?
The police always do, don't they?
I expected nothing else.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
And without much discrimination.
What's a buzzer?
How are you two getting along?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
The only answer I have for you.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
That COULD BE TOLD.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
What?
A little something on account perhaps?
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
I'll know when I find it.
Not too hard, is it?
Was that about the right angle?
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
May you what?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
What's this?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
It's kind of you to see me.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
To Ann.
Thank you.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Attributed?
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
I think it went on rather too long.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
I might.
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
That's enough of that.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Fuck off.
Hello.
What period?
All right.
I'm not here.
Now listen...
Darling Susan.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
Ah, Susy, it...
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
No.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
What's their program?
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
Don't screw around man, pull it!
But you're not alone.
Wild ride, huh?
Yeah?  What?
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Oh well he must be a surfer.
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
Kid, get outta the way!!
People are expendable to Bodhi.
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Ouch.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
There's something else, Major...
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
New York.
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
So do day jobs.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
I never joke about money.
No, but it's getting there.
What?
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Do you plan everything?
Why?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
It'd cost you.
Three.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
I'm sorry.
No.
What id we run into someone I know?
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Fuck off.
Shush.  Of course you can.
You won't.
I've never been on a plane before.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
What!?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
We just did.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
Vivian's in sales.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
I got a dress.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
What if they serve soup?
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Me?
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Excuse me?
Having a good time, Vivian?
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
Rest, Highness.
Does it bother you to hear?
I will never doubt again.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
We did it.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
-- where?
Have you any money?
I have a little.
Where did you get that?
Inigo.
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Yes.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
Why? You can't even lift one.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
Thank you for everything.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
Because I know something you don't know.
And what is that?
I must know.
Making sure nobody's following us.
I want to duel him left-handed.
Australia.
You're just stalling now.
You guessed wrong.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
Congratulations.
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
Here, don't panic.
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
But that's cheating!
Yes, what?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
You found a flop!
It won't run a week!
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
To failure!
Maybe it's not true!
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Yes.
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Always.
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Min Bialystock.
Get car.  Get car.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
No one met her?
Back where?
What do you mean?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
How did she pay you?
And when she left, she never came back.
Not at all!
Anyone at home?
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
With the forty thousand dollars?
I want to know if my sister is here.
Where?
I was getting to that!
Huh?
Where... can I stay?
Yes.
Stay here.
In a hurry.
Who's he?
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
You going to wait here for me?
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
It's regular. Okay?
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
Sam. This is the last time.
I have to go, Sam.
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
I haven't even been married once yet!
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
The bathroom.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
Uncommon, too.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
That's it. 
We have a problem.
Mary is Lila's sister?
Maybe you saw Mary!
Recluse. Kinder word.
Went out before service.
I suppose you want a cabin.
It isn't necessary.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Satisfied with your cabin?
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
Did I?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
He's inherited a fortune.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
No-
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
You--a friend to me?
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
But where do the rats come in?
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
What is it now?
What were you dreaming about?
A voice ...
Yes!
Did you hear?
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
So that's the way it is?
That's the way I feel about it.
Thank you.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
What! What are you talking about?
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
You mean he was colored?
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
We'll grant that.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Let it go.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
I told you he was a sore.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
That's what I said.
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
But I have some friends waiting.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
What did it want?
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
Is Rose here?
Well, I got to see her.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
Don't mention it.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
You better quit that.
I said I wouldn't.
Yeah.
Of course not!
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Well, it's not very plain.
But how would you find him?
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
I think Daddy suspects.
Yeah.
What's happening?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
I think we both know her.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Boys? You say to me boys?
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
No, sir.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
Yes, sir.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Mine.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Galley proof.
Galley what?
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Um-m, well...
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Illusions, Madam?
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Rose, you don't have to.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
What'd I say?
Bullshit.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Follow me.
Can't you say something nice once?
Our resignations.
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
You need a doctor.
Come again... ?
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I can't do it, Ben.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
I can't see.
Luke!
Wouldn't miss it.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Someone who loves you.
What's going on?
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Lower it!
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
Good, I hate long waits.
What are you telling them?
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
What's he saying?
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Yes or no will do.
You!
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Janet.
Yes Brad.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
No, don't do that.
Promise you won't tell Brad.
What a guy
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
I think you had better both come inside.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
What's funny?
Some people are very shy by nature.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
I should leave.
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Like?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Paulie, please --
Christ.
...Paulie. Stop now!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
You busted?!
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Damn.
Why?
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Six!
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
You think I don't hear things?
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Rocky, would you be interested in --
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Make your teeth yella --
I won't.
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
Did ya win?
Yeah, Kayo.
Freak luck for sure.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
Hey --
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
I'll do okay.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
A tweeting bird?
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
Maroon, right?
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
You?
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
Doom.
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No, I don't.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Keep reading...
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Leave Me!
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Am I like Such a fellow?
Farewell, my cuz.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Where is my Lady's lord?
[Within] Juliet!
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Pink for flower.
I will follow you.
I thought all for the best.
What wouldst thou have with me?
Nurse.
I don't know.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
About time!
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
You sure about this?
Shut up!
We'll double your price.
Here's yours.
Where's my information?
And more importantly --
We'll die if we stay here!
Is it done?
Soon.
So this is what, a test?
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
Gets the job done.
They call me Swede.
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
Like Larry or Swede.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
How did you know?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
I'm going with you.
You see the bullet?
You know him?
Do what?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
It is at that.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
Business keeps you on the road?
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
Finish the job...
And now...
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
Why's that?
Why didn't you kill her?
I'm alright.  And you?
Call it in I guess.  Why?
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
No.
Not bad enough to kill him.
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
Then we're screwed.
Uh huh.
And you're solid on that?
Whoa, Earl!
You mean that guy was an agent?
What for?
Nothing happened?
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
How the hell did he find it?
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
I know.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
What do you think about all this?
I guess we can get started.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Why would someone do that?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Yeah.
Anything I can help you with?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Yeah let's hear about your day.
You'd do this to me?!
What?
Well you're not getting, either.
And what happened?
Not in the trunk.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
Winner six!
El Capitan?
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
Carter, get off that stage!
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
You lied to me.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
How you doin'?
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Follow the Rich White Man?
What's she doing?
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
It's your turn!
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
She never even looked at you.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
See you in the next world.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
Mind your own business.
How was the sex?
Hello, Benjamin.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
That your gate down there?
Put your arms around me.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
You move well.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Baby Duck?
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
I know a shortcut.
Shortcut?
The license!  You get it?!
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
You like it?
You want more?
You know War?
Are you OK?
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
What are you talking about?
Where do we find him?
My daughter.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
He is very good.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
What do you expect me to say to this?
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
We do it to our dog.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Or a vegetarian?
Look, he's running after her.
Then come for dinner.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
Looking for Maggie.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Getting nervous?
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Six-fifty.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
Yes.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
Lost!
About a minute...?
I'm okay with that.
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
But I'm weird.
I'm just finishing up, too.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
Nope.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
I'll wait.
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
I do.
Walter.
So what happened?
At the top of the Empire State Building --
Oh!
Right.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
Becky?
M.F.E.O.?
You're going to miss the train.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
I know.
Are you Annie?
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Mom!
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
It's me?
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
No.
Is he home right now?
I don't know --
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
It is not --
I don't know.  Do I?
What is it?
Does red pepper go under R or P?
What?
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
Somewhere in the middle.
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
I know.
What was?
I don't know.
This is a good letter, Dad.
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Everyone at work heard you.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Did too.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I can't believe you flew first class.
Okay.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Yes?
What do you mean?
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
How's it going?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
What's the matter?
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
A meeting?
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Where are you going?
This is what we've been waiting for.
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
Go on. Spill it.
No ...
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
The what!
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
You've got to help around the house!
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
Not even a guess?
Ride 'em cowboy)
You like that?
Yeah.
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Then leave.
You get off on abuse or something?
That's long enough to get out of town.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
: What are you up to?
Nothing.
Who is it?
It's me.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
They would have killed you too.
Why?
Colette, go.
How you holding up?
I know a guy.
Nice day
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Fuuuuuck
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
Okay
But...I've seen you.
Pull your pants down.
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
I've got a hot one.
It's not my place.
When?
What the hell are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
This chink have a name?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Murder.  Beautiful.
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
You think that's a good idea?
Just admit you're wrong.
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Find a chaplain.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
You must be a hell a shot.
That must be four thousand yards.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
Last I knew.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
A half-track, anything.
How about that jeep?
Senator's son?
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Sure, you got one?
But, sir...
What'd you say, Captain?
You?  Leading a squad?
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
Maybe.
Since when have things been normal?
Nope.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
How about...?
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
You alright?
Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Trust me, you're the best.
Ours is not to reason why.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Up.  We're moving out.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
No, sir.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
And Sarge?
Frogs?
I usually like surprises.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
Demolition, right?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Because he's guilty.
Speak with my lawyer.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
I'll take the whole set.
Yeah.
I'll be in my office.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
What's a scam?
Lloyd, it's us.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Goodnight.
Dad.
Morning.
Lloyd?
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Hi.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Yeah?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
I'll go.
What are these?
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Twisted?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Okay, this is important...
No.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
What do you want?
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I love you.
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
How's it going?
Uh... okay... um...
No, really.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
Oh boy.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
I was gonna...
Certainly.
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
What -
In Breslau.
It's bad business.
You want these people.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
Better this month than last?
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
Would it do any good?
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
You're sure about this two person thing?
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
I heard a noise.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
What if I said goodbye?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
Cotton.
Can we talk?
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Fair enough.
Why don't you ask them?
No, I don't.
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
What guy?
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
And now, drum roll please...
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Oh--a God complex
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
Where is your attacker?
Time to change numbers again?
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
And white.
She's not here right now.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
But...
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Do I?
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
Who?
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
Four? There are five.
Jesus Gale what happened?
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
The killer called her.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
They've got her!
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
I'm sorry, this is too good!
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
What?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
What's your point?
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Your life?
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
It's Sarah.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
You ready to party hard tonight?
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
What are you doing here?
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
No...
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Are you serious?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Fuck you.
Yes.
Who is this?
Hello.
Hello.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
That's not what you said.
Then he dies. Right now.
Please don't do this...
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
...please...
Don't do this. I can't...
No...
But you're doing so well.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Afraid not.
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
Can I bring Kenny?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
She staying with you?
Please. You owe me.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Has his story changed?
And why would she do that?
LEAVEMEALONE!
Don't shoot. It's me.
You coming tonight?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Or a man's mentality.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Spit it out.
You should be thanking me.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
Just keep leading the way.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
No one yet.
Good.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Forced what?
This is the one thing.
There must be something.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
And so what?
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
This is a waste of time.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
Are you alright?
Wait... just wait.
We could use about fifty more men here.
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
Tell me it's not true.
Are you absolutely certain?
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
How should I know?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
Let's get along...
What in...?
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
JOINT action?
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
Why?
What?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Finish your breakfast...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
I got to fetch her home...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
We got two around that age...
Who was that?
Martin, it's not funny!
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Martin, what-
What?
For God's sake, what happened to me?
Ellen.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
Are you writing?
Ten pounds.
Nothing comes.
No, your marriage bed.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
No Juliet?!
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
It is all locked safe in here
No, it will turn out well.
Burbage says you have a play.
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
Not ready? Where is she?
Be good to her, my lord!
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
I would not for the world!
You can bring them with a word.
There is.
Moonlight!
Oh, do not go
Will you read it for me?
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
My hat?
Wait there.
It is only ours you can know.
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
What of her bosom?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
But what of Lord Wessex?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
All right, just a few questions.
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
No.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
I just thought we should discuss it.
Is this necessary?
What's wrong?
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
Well?
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Well, is it?
That's right.
Yes.
I thought you stopped going.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
Well, she had problems --
You're right.
Maybe he didn't like us.
Don't look?
I don't thinkI can.
I don't want to. It's different.
OK.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Oh, good.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
It's about the burglary.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
I see.
Is this where no one stays?
Are you all right?
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Right here?
In this firm.
Eh --
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Would you like to come in?
Chicken salad.
That kid... the hairdresser.
Maybe... why do you ask?
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
My keys.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
I don't want to see you anymore.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
Your husband?
Yes.
I hope she's all right.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
She what?
Shit.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
I asked you first.
Why?
Then what do you think?
She is.
Yeah.
How long you had this?
-- Well no. It never came up.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
It'll ruin everything.
You were great.
-- sure.
-- what?
-- very nice, very nice.
Me?
-- we are?
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't leave me...
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
Otis is dead.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
That's too bad.
Keep moving --
You're different.
I am?
Yeah.
We live together now.
Maybe you don't even like children.
You've never even been around one.
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
George.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Egypt.
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Well that's something.
What is.
That was him.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Did you?
No?
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Oh yeah?
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
I don't know what to...
All night.
Now wait a minute...
What, do you think I planned it?
What took you so long?
All right, who're you with? Jill?
You're home.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Of course not.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
What's that?
Fine.
I am? I mean why?
Well, he is.
You're really a love -- you sure?
Five times a day?
I'm exaggerating.
How much?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
-- never mind.
Good for you.
I don't think so.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
No.
Everything okay, son?
Call me Les.
I'm hungry.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
How's it going, Doc?
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
Dad?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Who's Tony?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
It's so pretty.
Danny?
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
She eh... interferes.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
I'm a Wendy.
Beg pardon?
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
It's good to see you.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Sure is.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
Did you find anything?
You mean just leave the hotel?
I don't know.
As soon as possible.
Of course I am.
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stop it!
Wendy give me the bat.
Jack, stay away from me!
I'm Jack Torrance.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Not for me.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Where's Mom?
What's that?
Rattling. Rustling.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
A tracer. You'll like it.
But Uncle Al! You said-
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
What you say?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
How are you doing.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Yes, Betty?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
I know.  It's ancient.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
What?
Like this place?
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Come on, we're late.
What?
A cigarette?
She won't?  Why not?
Oh my Lord!
Your name?
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
What? 
Are you talking about me?
What's a concubine?
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
No!  No!  I can't do this!
No food?
And whom would you call?
Your cell is more than adequate.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
A vote?
Oh?
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
Who are you guys?
But you didn't tell me!
Ice cream!
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Yes?
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
Where?
Who took the meat?
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
What are you spying on?
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Do you have these persons' wills?
May we look at them now?
Maybe you should take this.
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
What is that you wear?
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
Lady Van Tassel.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
Why would you do such a thing?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
What is so urgent?
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
Use caution.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
Where?
There was not much blood, was there?
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
You... you are alive.
He rides tonight.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
What you got in there, warshing?
You know what, by God?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
What's all them books?
Childers.
They let you out?
Yeah.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Two people.
Were they bad people?
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
Where'd you get them flowers?
Yeah, I recollect it.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Why not? It died?
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
You will? For sure?
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
Yeah.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
What brings you back?
Why are you here now?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
That boy wants me to.
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
It's my birthday.
And what are you, his chaperone?
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
And your father? Is he from New York?
What happened?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Are you closed?
Yeah, I did.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
They're all the same.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
Not a peep.
Hey, man, how's it going?
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
I mean, it's a good story.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
No you're not.
What's this?
Why don't you open it and find out?
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
What is this, some kind of joke?
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Thanks for the tip.
What can I do for you?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Thomas.
Well what?
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
What are you talking about?
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
Of course. Where else?
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Where did you get that thing?
I don't have much time. 
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
Yeah, it might be.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Fries?
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
Did you say more?
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
Still lashed to the mast.
You always run with the well open?
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
I believe so.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
I already said that, b...
I can't speak for him.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
I suppose you want a tip?
Thank you ever so.
What did he say?
No we're not.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
You'd better go fix it.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
Blow where?
But this is so humiliating.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
You know - the old shell game.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Like what?
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Hey - these are real diamonds.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
Are my seams straight?
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
I have a very low resistance.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
How did those holes get there?
What's the big idea?
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
You invest in shows?
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
Running away?  From what?
Afford it?
Really?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Your view of what?
Which one is yours - the big one?
- opening of the Opera -
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Three?
What a beautiful fish.
Champagne?
What's on Thursdays?
You mean you can't fall in love?
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Is that anything?
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Thank you.
Did you have a nice time?
Really?
Me?
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Spats Colombo.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Perfect. All ginny.
Fred Astaire and whats her face!
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
That was a long time ago.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
So, whats your point?
Youre not even listening.
You think we look like were trying too hard.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
I dont know.
Six thousand, right?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
A weekend?
This happened to you?
Oh, no.
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Hi.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Like fifteen.
So whyd you let him go?
Yeah.
I am now, sir.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
Colored.
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
They gone to the field...
You hurt, Daddy!?
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Did you find your father?
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
It's the heat.
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
Come, I'll take you home.
I'll walk...
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
They probly thought you was crazy.
Whatcha wanta order?
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
How's the weather out there?
Well, let's get to work!
Behold my glory.
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
Montana.
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Come on, just get to the message board!
YOU DO?!
CARTMAN!
Goodnight, honey.
Mom...
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Help yourself prickfuck!
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Guess.
Yeah, I guess.
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
I don't know, dude.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Yeah, so what do we say?
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
How is the children's progress?
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
What did you do today Satan?
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
It can't be.
Well I appreciate that.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
It's a little late for you to be up.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
You're certain of that?
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
That's me.
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
What are we going to do?
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
Taylor?
Dawn!  Dawn!
Oh my God.  What happened?
What's that?
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
So what's going to happen to you?
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
What is it?!
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
You're not from around here, are you?
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
That game was before you was born.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
We ain't married no more.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
What about bowling?
Theo. Howzitgoin.
You shouldn't touch her.
Who's there?
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
He's my father, Millie.
What's your specialty?
Uh...over easy.
Do you know where they're taking him?
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Where did your brother escape from?
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
No, I'm fascinated.
Well, that was plan A.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
Zip.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
He's dead Sheila.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
What about plan C?
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
Your time is up, busyboy.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Norman, please!  Don't!
We're moving fast considering the storm.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
-- Wait a second --
Maybe older --
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
Edmunds?
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
It's not sucking, sir.
What caused it?
Well, where the fuck is he?
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
What?
So how do we get it open?
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
Look at this.
They switched us over.
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
Yeah, why?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
So what?
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
Don't tell me to calm down!
You did, didn't you?
Forget the sub.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Fixing it.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
You think, in the sphere --
It's for motion sickness.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tarazine?
Riordan?
Parasolutrine?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
It's an idea.
Where are you?
You think I'd really drink that?
Don't you?
You think I manifested the snakes?
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
C'mon --
Get away from me!
Pussy.
No.  I don't think so.
Well, what's your theory?
For who?  The fish?
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
How are you feeling, Norman?
C'mon, Norman.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
What noise?
Harry?
What happened to her?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Gimme a second --
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
Who's everyone?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Squint harder.
Please, Ted.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
You could put it that way.
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
What do I do?
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
There are only three or four left.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
He was our teacher... He was great.
How do you make him do that ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
So what are you doing later ?
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Zander, what are you doing ?
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
I'm gonna miss you.
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Hi, mom.
What do you think you're doing ?
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Who is...'V'ger'...?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
Our data is being prepared.
<U>Answer</U>!
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
I'm aware of that, sir.
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
Hello, Ilia.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Time to impact...?
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
I still contain fragments of my human half.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
I...
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
Yes.
But, but but but...
...who...?
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
<u>How</u>...?
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Hello.
I thought you had Play Practice.
"Room Service!"
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Hi.
Why?
What've you got?
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
No, that's true.
How's your star?
We could live up here, live up in the country.
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
But it'll stop the movie.
Carla was in the car, right?
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
After Drama Group.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
We had a date.
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Big day last night.
Wat...
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
...why am I here...?
Waterford, Vermont.
How big is this horse?
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
What'll I do for fun?
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
You can go...
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
<u>Bobby</u>...
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
What's his name?
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
Who is that...?
That's my...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...I...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Why?
...he's the producer of the movie.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
What?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
Sure.
I can only write on a manual.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
I want to make a good film.
I know you do.
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
What did you say to them...?
My oh my.
<u>Pay</u> her.
Pay her off.
She wasn't in...you were al...
There's no witnesses...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
...we can't lose the wind...
Why?
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
I'm gonna call him.
How would you know sh...
I hope it's the right kind.
Annabelle...wake up honey...
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
Yes.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
Help me here...
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
Great.  Big ears, too?
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
Ice cold water.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Mommy's sick, guys.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Rache says it's from you.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
I'm here.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
Our children.
It's a huge moment in their life --
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
What did you do?
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
But it's not on the schedule!
Yeh?
However many.  It's not enough.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
It's the same choice you made.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
And her...?
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
You're the hip and fresh.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
For what?
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Rache, get out of th...
It's forever you know.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
Can we go sit somewhere?
What if he is?
What?
There are some rumors...
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Thank you.
I did not go to high school.
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
He wasn't.
This is definitely better.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
Twinkeys!
Yes, Mikey?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Fine.
Huh?
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
What DO you know?
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Come here, give me a hug!
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
No.
...gger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Great. How old are they?
I know.
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
So where'd you get in?
Prnceton.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
Let's move it we got company!
Forget about it.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
Go fuck yourself...
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
So, what are we looking at White?
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Agreed--let's move it.
Possibly some coffee?
I have your word, Mister President?
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Where is this...thing?
I know nothing of the sort!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
What are you talking about, Major?
Now, snap out of it, fella!
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
That's government property, Major.
What is your name, young lady?
No, sir.
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
Does the threat board show anything?
Well, Mister President.
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
That is correct, Major.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
I know that, sir.
You're damned right they are.
How much soda, sir.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Do you think they would cheat?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
Have you tried the recall again?
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
What else could it be?
Then this is it.
Just the missiles.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Shoot, Lothar.
That's what I said.
Check target approach.
Release first safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
Where'd they get you?
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
What do you mean?
Look, this is different.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
I said that's the point!
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I get a red light.
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Let me check.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
Yeah, I guess.
Slides go with it.
Yup.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Right now?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Now?
It's your birthday?
Don't let 'em fight.
No, he's not with a girl.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Ah!
A long, long, long...
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Sure.
Uh, last night...
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Wait. Hey, man.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Come on.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
You better! Yes!
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
A Porsche.
I'd like to.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Mm.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Deep down. Way down.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Can you tell me what happened?
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Sooze wants to see him.
See ya later.
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
I don't know.
Jeff, stay there.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
That's right.
Your sure as hell right about that.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
About what?
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
But do you stand for anything?
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
This is ridiculous!
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Come with me.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
No, no.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
Come on.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
I, yeah.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
Wait, away?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
What?
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah, I crash there.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Oh, yeah.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
You do not!
You do not want me to do your cover.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Jesus, Jeff.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm moving.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Yeah?
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Tim?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
No car.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Diane?  Diane!
You sure?
No.
Spit from your dad?
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Let me explain something...
Shut up.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Hi, Artie.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
Thanks.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
What teacher?
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
Why should you do that?
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Oh, you --
Who's Norma?
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Second generation, huh?
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Yes, I did.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
You're a writer, you said.
And you'll play Salome?
Well?
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
I don't know.
I want you to do this work.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'll take care of that.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
What scene?
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
Hold me tighter.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
Did she read the script?
Have one of mine.
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
Where are my cigarettes?
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
This room has not been used for a long time.
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Haven't got a thing.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Bring something to drink.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
What do you want?
When can I see, you again ?
Let's talk about us, not her.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Just like that?
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Guess! Go on.
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Why didn't you tell me?
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
I'd rather not talk about it.
She did that deliberately.
He's nice.
Nigel, get lost.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
I know.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
You look at them? How?
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
You're welcome...??
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Peanut butter and jelly.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
Well...  Not quite like this.
Say!
Mmmmm . . .
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Yeah.
Nope, but --
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
The boss wants to see you.
Columbia.
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
How do you do that?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Is this whitemail?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
You designed it?
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
No, we're just going down.
We back in Metropolis?
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
We've already met.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
Turn on the light.
Oh, Superman!
I can't! It's out of control!
Missing????
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Today coffee----
Maybe I could try --
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Let's go to my place.
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Genius!  --  Lex.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
		DELETE IN CUTTING
I've never been in a place like this before.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Awesome!
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
An angle?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
What I need this for?
You are . . .
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
You're a great architect, Albert.
A hot story, huh?
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Lois isn't here?
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Actually, she's silver-haired.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
It wasn't a trick!
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
Besides that.
So I've noticed.
Bet he makes it.
Krypton!
Mr. Romance...
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
A night on the town instead of under it?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
It's a ...baby.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
How good it felt!
Lois, the kickback story...
Do as I say. Let go!
With my luck, now it'll rain.
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
It's not bad.
What color underwear am I wearing?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
Please...
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
Of time, Luthor.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
Which clinic?
I'm...so sorry.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
What happened?
Alison.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
C'mon, you know that won't...
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
What time's he coming home?
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Yes.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
I have to.
Yes.
About the Ottos?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
And they loved Bear.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
You talked about it?
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Did his parents attend to that?
Did they give him special care?
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
You hate it.
I didn't say that.
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
So do you like your new room?
It's interesting.
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
She...she was a friend of mine.
What do you mean?
Tell me about the Ottos.
Need a hand?
I'm in a car wash.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
That's not news, Zoe.
I need money.
We do.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
You've been retained?
Are you expensive?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
You're going to blow everyone away.
What took so long?
How do you like it, Nicole?
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
Will you mind your own business!
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Is "he" inside?
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
Who said Sidney?
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
Uh huh.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
And who's feet is she on now?
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Are you listening?
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
I thought he would.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
In his apartment -
What would you think of me if -
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
I can't
No one must follow your work.
Can I stop by my house?
You sure?
Does it hurt?
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Chill out, dickwad.
Excellent.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
I got it.  Piece of cake.
They took him from me.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
And no elbows on the table!
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
Where you from, David?
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Yeah.
Yes.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
Think you can get me any of that?
Mine's the Eleventh.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
Why were they going to arrest you?
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Tell me about von der Null.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand what you mean.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Do you know what's in this archive?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Show me.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
What?
He did?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Who's he?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Like this bandleader.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
Freezing.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
What?
What's he like?
I volunteered.
Bag some Z's?
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Someone?
It's better that way.
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
And who was the enemy?
Why?
Surrounded by living tissue.
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
Admittedly...
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
Now, look...
It was an accident.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Oh, God... !
Don't just stand there, get help!
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
Please...
Seriously?  What did they say?
Okay.
Do you mind if I sit?
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
They're watching.
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
What do you think you're doing?
Who's responsible?!
I saw them kill him!
Stop talking to them!
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
They'll be wanting it back.
Are you still on mediction?
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
What's this all about, Connie?
How do you know?
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
Yes.
I'll explain someday.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
It's different every time.
May I make two suggestions... ?
Physical?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Hm?
Didn't I give you two?
Thank you.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
His behavior... ?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Look, where is he?!
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Anything wrong... ?
Nicholas...
Just what I told you.
You're joking.
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Why?
You used the wrong test.
Nell!
All the carvings.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
Hmm.
Are you coming to confess?
What?
Oh God, we can't get out!
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Yes.  I've missed it.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
Nell, what happened?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
Then what good is he?
It's not a knock.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
Why?
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
What's the matter?
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Same as last time -- the rest after.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
You broke last time.
CQ what?
I didn't expect anyone.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
No one else is even here yet.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Didn't get it.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Modelling.
When did you get in?
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
What about your grandmother?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
And that is?
Yeah, that's right.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
You do?
Like what.
So why would he want to see you.
You've made it ... brighter.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Pleasure.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
We've certainly missed you.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
Geez, Mr Crane.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
You're an enthusiast.
...I wanted to make you happy.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
...Mm.
I don't understand.
No. I--tell me--
Way out of line.
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
That'll be fine.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
How much to they want, Dave?
...Oh, Jesus.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
But it's...
...What kind of man *are* you?
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
So?
Honey...
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
Honey...
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
OK, how did you know?
...I don't think so.
Oh, hell. Drink?
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
...So, uh, who should I--
...Probity.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
...Did you make that up?
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Huh?
Yeah.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
That's very generous.
...We goin'?
Huh?
Doesn't bother me.
Second chair.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Forget it!
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
The body?
What's left of it.
Whose footprints?
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Call me Vince.
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
I hope you liked it.
Curious.  There's something missing.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
What is it?
What's going on?
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Big as a house.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Shut them up!
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
How?
<i>Fiji.</i>
Today.
<i>A month.</i>
Why wouldn't I?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
--a dead one at that.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
The creator of what?
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Who?
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
How did it go today?
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
Good night, Mother.
Arrah!
Oh, my God!
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
Let's go now.
So why do you want to go?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
--What the hell are you talking about?!
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Not supposed to talk about it.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Poopy day?
Does what?
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
This man's still alive.
How's that?
Those people were already dead.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
You know my work?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
You told me you had answers.
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
Scully...
They were the ones that put us together.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
I'd been told as much.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
How was it contracted?
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
Well, call General McAddie.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
I'd be there for him.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I don't need them anymore...
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Agent Novak?
Peter, okay?
I did, yeah.
Then what is he?
Wait...
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Delano?
You're kidding me.
What about narcotics?
Dr. Kent.
So?
Now?
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Den leuten.
Ja, ja, ja.
Thank you.
He has a little dog.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
...to steal my girl.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
A parrot...Let it go.
How do you know?
Oh, the usual things...
...parents.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Martins.
Yes.
Holly Martins.
Get the next plane.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Do you see what that means?
So would I.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
Be sensible, Martins.
Do you know his number?
I'll look it up for you.
You do!
Heard of Harry Lime?
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
What do you want me to do?
You can get somebody else...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
...your address?
Are you mad?
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Excuse me!
Kurtz.
You don't mean that doctor?
Joseph Harbin.
...this time.
Should I make it all fact?
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
One or two kilometers.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
So how many miles do you think it is?
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
It's on an island that no one get to.
Have you told someone?
I think so too.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
We lost our key.
So?
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
They sound like you.
What??
Do we have to listen to this shit?
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Yeah, but not on the letters.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
I don't care about money.
Bigger and better.
Where'd you get this?
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Did you see how they reacted to him?
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
What??!?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
And? WHat did you notice?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
What were you, following me?
I don't think you know what you are.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
How did you get the fucking number?
Hello...?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Tell it to Hitler.
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
You said they didn't have night guards.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
You remember Miriam....
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
You missed on purpose.
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
Howard Stern.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
But your man isn't quite a God!
Did you tell him?
Did the driver really freeze?
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
He seems to have won it.
I tell you she's mine!
You know each other?
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
Well, good night, then...
Checking out the competition.
Is he alright?  What happened?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Have the car painted.
Then tell him to wax it too.
Yes?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
Enzo?
What?
Why?
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Good night.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
You were right.
... Push me back in the water...
I recognize you.
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
So have I.  ... Hello?
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
Hello?
You sure?
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
You'll try again tomorrow?
What are you doing?
Jacques...?
What's wrong?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
You called the police?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
There won't be any need for that sir.
It's Esther.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
Hammer, you alright?
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
Sure.
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Love is different for different people.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click  click  click.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Why?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
To the eye? Like other men.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Tormented -- ? Why?
I thought they came right past here 
Yes. The lipstick.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Are you all right?
	As long as my feet held out.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
Excuse me?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Laurence!
Youre mad...
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
My brother hung himself.
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I dont know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didnt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Here we go again.
Do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother?
Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
Get a pen and dont ask any questions.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people!  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
Yes... Good, good...
On the bed!
Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
What about the staff?  Theyre in on whats going on, arent they?  How many of them?
Where is it?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
My rates...
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Have you?
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Good reasons?
Is she on the phone?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Would you know where I might reach her?
Whats an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Three...
If he had, youd be dead.
I think youd rather not know what I think.
What do you think?
I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
What do you mean?
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Very generous of you all.  How much?
It's a miracle she's not dead!
Now?
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
I am ready now...
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I can't read.
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
Really?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
The voice was in your cell?
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
I'm... I'm not the king...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
His face.
Yes... they were.
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
Yes, it's a miracle.
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Do you know how to count?
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Jeanne... what are you doing?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
They won't come anyway.
God asked you to do something?
What signs?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
In His name??
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Are you going to leave me too?
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Him?
Only God knows the answer to that.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Really?
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Dorota.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'm on the run!
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
What?
What?
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Boys, boys...
That's better than yesterday.
I can look after myself!
Jehuda, give me something to do.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
How long have you been here?
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Szpilman.
To be deaf?
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
No sound at all?
I worry for you.
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
I'd like to make a swap.
You don't want to learn.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
You have to wash them.
Wash them again.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
What did she say?
She wants it to come.
Mama.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
I like griftin'.
Yes sir.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
I'll take him anyway.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
What do ya mean?
How 'bout Lonnegan?
No.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Looks like he's sulking.
I guess I left it in my room.
But what about all these other people?
It isn't any better.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
You're dreamin', kid.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
And you were gonna pay me back?
Why don't ya then.
I'll make parole.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
What's your next step, Nick?
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
How are you?
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Oh!
tried him once -
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Dead?
He'll still be your son-in-law!
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
I know -- I know --
You can take that out to the car.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Did you kill her?
How'd you people happen to pop in?
What's he want of you?
No.
I'll have to try to remember.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
Get anything?
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Where were you?
I'll get some.
Who's that man?
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
What bonds?
Don't you remember....
Go ahead!
You're going to return every cent of it!
I'm not telling anyone.
Never mind.
Thanks, and goodbye.
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
Hello, Mimi.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Where's Gilbert?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
You did... where?
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
Why do you say that?
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
What are you drinking?
What are you going to do with it?
No.
Maybe a drink would help you.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Want a drink?
I never saw that before.
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
What's the matter with you?
Maybe I will.
But Wynant --- ?
Looks like a hold-up!
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
What do you mean?
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
Yes!
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Where are you going?
Home!
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
What's in the other direction?
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
We've got rope?
Where'd they go?
What am I supposed to do?
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
You said he was a deserter.
What about Jaeger?
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
What are you doing?
There might be something in there.
You think?
Now this is war.
Invest it.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
What?
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
You can't tell anybody about this.
SAY IT!
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
Just relax.
We're going to be right over here.
It's a fire fight.
Wait.
What the hell took so long.
What if he's not?
I don't want to die.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
I pick that way.
Well?
Oh, God...
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Some good ones.
You will.  You'll get it.
Jaeger?
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Think we can make it?
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
4732...?
Vocasity
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
You don't know.  You don't....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Good Lord!
There goes another of your disciples.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
You're in violation.
I'll report you.  It's....
I was lost.
Which way?
We've lost SEN!
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
That's not it.
She's not there
Where's LUH?
Yes.
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
Officer Reilly, vice.
Coffee, Mike?
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
You guys seem pretty tight.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
What's up?
Which one's which?
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
You got it.
Any word?
Alex, please-
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
You touch me again and--
Prints?
What about the ballistics report?
Look who's talking, old man.
Make an appointment.
P.E.T.N ...
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
So what're we looking for?
What's this?
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
Diamonds all over.
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
No!
Eleven o'clock! 
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
You're looking fine, Major.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Nice suit.
Smart. London, eh?
Just dull.
I would start with cocktails.
I want to see-- 
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
I've got to see you.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
You say I am a crook.
M'sieu Monescu!
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
No--no.
Disappointed?
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
Please.
Ah!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
Yes.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
That's what you need!
What shade of powder do you use?
Do you know my first name?
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
Eighteenth century.
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Then a little nap--
Hair?
You would?
Like that?
Instantly.
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
I know!
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
That's true.
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
The partners want to know how it's going?
She's not on the starboard side either.
I make my own luck.
An accident?!
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
Is this in any way unclear?
You're precious to me, Rose.
Sure. Count me in.
Bollocks.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
We've struck ice.
No you won't.
No.
HELP! HELP!!
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Yes, exactly!
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
Now it's worse.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
I'm sorry.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
Feeling a little better, I see.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
Guess again, copper.
How about giving me another coat?
Tell me.
Isn't she attractive?
Don't rub it in.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
Don't let's talk about it.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
How well do you know her?
Lose?--I won a little--
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
I thought you were a smart guy.
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
Nix, the law!
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Are you screwy?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
About sixteen hundred.
Partners, ain't we?
You keep it-- 
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
Three Jacks.
It's your deal.
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Hello, young fellow!
Here's your fifty.
That's too bad.
How?
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Well, did you find me?
Who won?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Are you happy?
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
Everything O.K.?
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Meaning what?
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
He's all right.
Thanks to me.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
Nothin'.
Let me look at it.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Where'd you get that horse?
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
I want them spitting blood!
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
I'm retired.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Age quod agis.
Better.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
That's great coming from you.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
Colorado's closer
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
You're a little touchy about it.
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Just doesn't, that's all.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
That what you got me up here for?
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Acquired?
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
But -
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
How did you get this number?
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Briefly.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
Where can I find him?
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Paris -
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
That's reassuring.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Sidney Winch, meet -
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
... Do you have a gun?
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
If not?
And number two?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Sorry I'm late -
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
You won't get away with this!
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
That was too close.
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
Will it go off?
I pay my own way.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
Yes.
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Now how far would further out be?
Your feet are cold.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
Harry, you know everything.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
How many people do you all feed?
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
Did you have your child at home?
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
Wow!  Cool!
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Can I bring some toys?
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Next stop...
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
What are you doing over there?
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Come on, this way!
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Shhhhhhh!
Ha-ha!!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
What?
I don't know!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
ROOAAAARR!!!
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
I'm red this time.
But you're Irish!
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Stop it!
So did I.
Why does he need money?
Why are you talking like that?
What is he being charged with?
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Did you get it?
I was just waiting for the right time.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
I think she's lying.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Did you tell Dad?
Is this bad for him?
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
I get A's.  All A's.
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
Not Tiger Woods.
David --
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
Fine, then we don't have deal.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
What?
Bit fucking late, like.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Great.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Jesus.
Are you clean?
You're too young.
It's Iggy Pop.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
What? Steady like?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Director?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
So who else?
I don't rate that at all.
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
Well, it's up to you.
What's on the menu this evening?
Excellent.
Sure.
This had better be good.
Where did she come up with that?
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
This is the Starship Enterprise.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
What's going on?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
No, but you can bet they will.
Where did you get this power?
The power was within you.
But how?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Go to sleep, Spock.
I could use a shower.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
There, you see? See?
Who are you?
About the ship...



Each man's pain is unique.
I hide no pain.
I know you better than that.
I don't understand...
Hi, Alan.
Did he say why?
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Okay, okay...
For what?
Hello, Alan.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Alan. Alan Bailey.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
User requests are what computers are for.
That was uncalled-for.
How about you?
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
But-what if I can't...?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
You bitch.
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
I'm done.
Dana, are you listening to me?
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Why?
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
Helen's going to be pissed.
Give me the page.
She's still at my house.						*
He's got it.
But you didn't.  Why not?
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
It's certainly... dramatic.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
Would you say he was boring, then?
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
Louder please.
I think so.
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
I'm sorry, honey.
I don't take those assignments.
Boris and Doris?
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
How?
Not yet.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
There's nothing to tell.
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
Uh-huh.
What did he do to Arlene?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
Was it him or you?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
So you do eat pussy!
Live with what?
I don't blame you.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
It's great to hear from you.
Tomorrow.
What?
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
I certainly hope so.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
Really?
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
Yeah?
Say it, goddamn it!
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
What makes you think I could do that?
No shit?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
No.
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
Sure. No problem.
Not a tiny little vial -
Or a bit player -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
How the fuck could he know?
He saw the wire.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
No.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Yes.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
What was the Jew-boy's name?
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
I understand.  There'd be no point.
That's him.
And your only goal is...???
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
What kind of information?
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
No more drugs.  Please...
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
What?
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
Are you hurt?
Mason???
The guy was a total fruitcake.
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
I don't understand what we're doing.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
It was?  I didn't...know.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
What does this mean to you?
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
I'm not crazy.
What....???
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
Nine thirty
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Will be.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
How much.
But he's dead.
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Hey.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
It is morning.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Taking a little trip?
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
It's Grace.
No, I've got it.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
I just drove in this morning.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
A medicine man?
Doesn't the heat bother you?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
You love him?
Did you ever?
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Yeah.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
Shit!
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Give him the money.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
I think I busted my leg.
What for?
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
Live there?
Would I what?
No.
About things.  About your wife.
You're talking like a mad man.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
All I have in the world.
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
It's not like that.
I came for Grace.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Two-hundred dollars.
You expect me to believe that?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
You're fucked.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Now, what's this?
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
You want something?
You can't do that yourself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
What?
Who's cursed?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Mister!
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
Accident.
That's a solid name.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I did?
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You're talking like a madman.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
Shhh! Liar.
Come on, Jake --
I've had time to get over it.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
Nope.  Darrell.
You own this place?
How much time?
What the hell happened to my car?
How much!?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
No charge.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
I want my car.
Thank you, Bobby.
You're not from around here, are you?
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
Did you like it; me watching you?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
What?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Nothing.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
I don't know about that?
I'm not sailing his boat.
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
Beck's.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
What was that all about?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
I don't think I got the job in New York.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Is Jeremy okay?
I don't know. It's been a while.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
You've never been sick?
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
He's kind of a miracle.
Yeah?
I want to sleep here tonight.
Just one--
I'm going to work out.
I'll help you.
I mean if you knew karate?
You're lying.
Why?
Well, go get it then.
I fined 'em instead.
Where'd you get the money, huh?
We was... lyin'.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
He didn't say nothin', huh?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
Nope.
He give 'em names?
Three days. Are you hungry?
Free ones?
Books. He's my biographer.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
That much, huh?
What's your name?
It's only a b-b-b-book...
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Ned's share?
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
Yeah, I guess so.
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Well, how about it?
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Well... I don't recollect.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Huh?
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
Yeah.
Jesus.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
He's dead, Bill.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Who's he?
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Three.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
Yeah.
Jesus.  You done this before?
Jack. What are you doing here?
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
I know who he is.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
You heard right.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
County. I was in for fraud.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
Tough break.
with what?
Mr. Soze will be most -
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
When does he post bail?
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
Right.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
I don't
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
I'm fine.
Yes.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
And no one will know the truth.
Gruber...
This is going to drive the ante up.
...I was one of a group of...
Anything special about the case?
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Objection, we've...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
I . . ..
You've just said you signed it.
... that's all right.
I completely understand ...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
I appreciate--a man as busy as--
Right.  Who called?
Yes.
The most respected ...
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Nothing further, your Honor...
I can't guarantee that...
Mr. Galvin's...
Yes.  Price...
I'm a lawyer.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Do you want me to go...?
You, you don't under...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
... now who is that ...?
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Been a long time, huh...?
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
That's right.
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
... I'm sure you do ...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
She told me.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yes.
Yes.
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Me, too.
No, I'm all right.
Would you like a drink now?
Then?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
No.
I want you.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Nothing.
What happened?
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Your name. And --
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Dinner... and what else?
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
An hour?
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No? Then what?
Judy --
Mmmm.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Can't you see?
Yes!
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
Wandering about.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
How old?
Long ago...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
What else?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
I'm here, I've got you...
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Yes.
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
It wasn't your fault.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
Uh-huh!
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Out. I've got things to do.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
Well...
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
How ya doing?
What?
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
What did you say?
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
What?
Calling the ambulance.
We have to call the ambulance.
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
What?
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
At the seven-eleven.
Adam! Calm down.
They're driving me nuts!
They're screaming for Starbursts.
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
Money?
Well, oh...
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
Yup.
What's goosed?
What is the question you asked me?
What's your point?
Take care of business.
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
False.
They need leadership.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
Stop.
This is ridiculous.
Government cutbacks.
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
Photographer?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Don't you dare.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
He is.
He's weird.
Where are you?
The chairs.
What's the word on the chairs?
Now?
Yeah. You.
Do you love me?
Call the police.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
What?
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Just kills me...
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
That ought to be about the end of that.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
A mutant species.
Good times.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Two.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Come down here, you scamp.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
You must think I am a monster.
You must listen to me before you go.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Yes.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
He was asking for it.
What's the matter with you?
Why the bad temper?
And this chest?
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
What do you know about me?
What are you doing here? Get out.
Do they worry you that much, then?
Are they going to work here too?
You'll soon find out, you liar!
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
How did you see me?
From the terrace.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
What about them?
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
Their weapons missing?
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
What's the assignment?
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
What did Cox pull him out early for?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
I'm still making adjustments...
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
SID  NO!!!
I am beautiful, aren't I?
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
I've been in prison, remember?
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Relax. I know what you meant.
Enjoying yourself?
Start of what?
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
See something?
More or less.
Then shoot him already.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
<u>Lure</u> him. 
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u>, Johnny Green wrote that song, and...
Come on.
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Don't you want to know if it's true?
<u>Do</u> it...
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Anything at the Airport?
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
Where is he?
We're due at Andrews. 
Whaddaya think?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
Ask it.
Would you go to War to do that? 
I have.
What do you want the kid to say?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
Is that true?
"The Country Is At War." 
What do we have that they want?
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
...it's a Teaser!
Mmm.
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
No, I didn't think so.
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
Show Must Go On.
Watch me.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
Do it later...  Okay,  now, "The Little Girl," who is she, what is she doing?  She is....she's ...Okay, okay, it's an Albanian village... She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop.  They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.
Better.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
What would be true, then.
I'm just talking about the Hats.
A wider option of what?
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
...gotta read my reports.
That's great Dad.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
...I can't make it tonight.
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Upper West Side.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
Why?
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
Hmm.
Thank you Jenkins
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Can this be stopped?
I know that.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
How?
Yes, but...
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
No.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Who are you?
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
Um...sure.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
They're calling me in to work.
What was her major?
He looked like one of the Monkees.
...just so she could cut them off.
Do we have to?
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
She's making this up.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Yep.
Telling you...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Oh...
I think so
Then what was it?
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
Like what?
Claire?
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
It's just us now.
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Maybe we should just...
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
That's not what I'm sug--
Hi.
In the house.  I was scared.
Did you call about the Feurs?
A flare?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
When?
Oh.
...like it never even happened...
Harvey says he's amazing.
What are you...?  No.
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Yep.
I felt you...looking through me...
I may have seen her on campus.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
The...
Stop...
...I'm positive this time...
Oh God...
So you fucked a student?!
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
She did it.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
Don't think so.
Shhhh.
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
There are two.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
Nothing was ever more false.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
I beg your par---
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
Lasher - bring us through!
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
Go away!  I don't want you here.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
I'm glad you're around to say it.
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
Just one.  The bar's closed.
And whose houses do you design...?
Too much... too fast...?
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
God knows, I'm intriguing.

Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
Do you love me, Michael...?
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
OH MY GAWD!
I thought you were someone else
That's right...
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
What are you doing?
So what do you do?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
I don't know...
then why did you marry her -
Why should I?
STEPHANIE?
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
What?
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
Her husband left her
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
ANGEL...
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
Cut it out, before you break something!
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Get them together.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
Let me get this straight...
Ladies first.  I insist.
Which you pulled, hard!
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
I mean, what do you think?
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Finally, some gratitude.
It's okay. You need me?
Watch your tone, mister.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
That's me.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
My legacy.
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Me-ow.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
I don't get the distinction.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
What about you?
Tell me more.
Do you trust me, Julie?
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You're quick. I like that.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
You promise you'll finish school?
Like what?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
I'm warning you.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You called the cops on us?
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
How soon can we get something?
About Suzie?
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
No.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
It's our job, Gloria.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
Unless what?
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
About a year ago.
No.
So you were alone.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Are you crazy, Ray?
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Where, the mall?
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Hello.
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
Forget it.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
It doesn't look like it.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
That was about as grim as it gets.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Aha?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
At least I tried something.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
It is?
Relax.  We're almost there.
What is that?
Are those just button buttons or...?
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Really?
Look, I'm Captain James West...
French?
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
He had a pressing engagement.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
The first.
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
Why not?
Sorsha.
Then you get us out of here.
We're a tiny version of all that?
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Want me to carry Elora?
You must learn magic.
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
Who is he?
Ohhh, I hate this.
This is not going well.
Cows. You know, cows?
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
John, why?...
Nail it!
Everything is all right, John.
No pistol. Ever.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
You have no right to keep us here.
Now what's the problem?
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
Home.
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
Who are they?
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Anything against zippers?
Where's the nearest telephone?
I know what he said.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Anybody know about this?
Johnny, what the fuck?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You'd lie to protect him.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
Yes, thank you very much.
What's so funny?
Who was that man?
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
He'll live.
Momma... are they angry with us.
They are English. They don't understand.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
If she...
Our echo.
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Ahh!  Ah!
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Oh, now?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
And him a brain.
Dorothy!
Lions and tigers and bears!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
A home --
I'll be home in time for supper!
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
What happened?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Yes, you.
Stop pushing!
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
That's right.
We do.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Let's.
...to Dorothy!
It makes you nervous?
Well --
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
Stop that dog!
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Zukovsky...
Weve got to get out.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Who?
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
Your last chance. Take the money.
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
How long has he been with you?
Does this look familiar to you?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
I thought you were the one in her business.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
And the payoff on the tables?
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
Any word from him?
Why?  What's the problem?
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
What's your theory?
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
I won't do that.
What -- am I --
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
We should get back --  What?
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Jon??  You mean he's --
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
What is this place?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
Up yours.
Thanks.
Yes it does.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Yorgi asked me to.
What are you?
I'm from L.A.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
Aren't you afraid?
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
What are you doing?
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
You're serious?
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
What's so damn funny?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
Scott.. I -
I don't like him being here.
What's wrong with him?
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
You know, you --
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
Let go.
I've seen a lot of rings.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Miss me?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
And your passport?
Love me?
Are you suggesting I call him master???
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
That's a tough choice.
I suppose you're right.
Good night.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Well... we'll see.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
Fro-derick!
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
What a filthy job!
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
Throw the second switch!
More, do you hear me?
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
Thanks...for all your help.
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Raise the platform, hurry!
All right -- give it to him!
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, I have mine.
Yes, I know.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
How long is it so far?
Food!
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Which one?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
