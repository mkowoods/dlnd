Forget it.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You always been this selfish?
I hope so.
Who?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
But you hate Joey
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
Why didn't you tell me?
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
That's what I just said
It's her favorite band.
Sure
Then, go get her
They're running the rest of me next month.
Away.
Forget her sister, then.
Block E?
William would never have gone to a state school.
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
Just let me sit down.
What?
Busy
This.
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Pleasant?
Unwelcome.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
You never disappointed me.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Oh yeah.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Good enough.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
You're not helping.
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Why?
Chief says...
Ask him if he will help.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I knew you would.
What did they say about Granada before today?
Surely you can do anything you want.
A woman?
Twenty eight.
Oh, sure.
But it's...
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
I will if they don't send me back.
What about back home?
In the kitchen.
Go on.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
It was my decision, not his.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Who do you think, Chief?!
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
You ready?
Any I.D.?
Describe him.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
Of course.
So am I.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Well, that's great.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
Jesus Christ.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Where is escort service?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Yes.  Both.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Milos.  Get my money!
It's easy to learn.
Well, he...
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
What??
The clerk?
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
Right. Just a sec.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Are you reasonably awake?
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Thank you, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Are you quite sure?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Opening pod bay doors.
Great, just great.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Pros.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
You're done.  End of story.
You're crazy.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I'll think about it.
No way to start a partnership.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
What are you talkin' about?
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Shit.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Jack?
I lost them, that's what happened.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Hi, it's me...
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
This ain't a credit business.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
They are robots!
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Don't exist bud.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
...Ma???
Does it get any better or what!
Uh... not really.
Yeah, very big, a giant.
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
Got it...
It's like a cab isn't it?
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
What mission?
Three of us will never fit in there!
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
OK, you can turn around!
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
I'm so tired...
I love you...
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Wait or act.
Amen..
How's our deal coming along?
I'm not accusing you...
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What are you talking about?
Hmm.
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Take out your gun!
Bring the film, or we kill him.
Call me Tom.
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
What do you want?
I told you, I don't know.
How much did he pay you?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Something like that.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Because we're going there.
You enjoy it?
Tell me what happened.
Show me where you buried her.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Where are your parents?
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Where does he sell it?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
See ya.
Great.
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You're joking.
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
We're all like that.
If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
Her belongings?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Then we'll stay up together.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
"In her dream"?
Is there something we can do?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
It's okay, we're just about there.
It was Freddy.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
You're not taking my baby!
He's inside you, where he hides.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
So did Dan.
My baby!
I don't know!
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
I'd sooner swim!
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
So?
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
There's got to be an explanation!
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
That's what I said!
Always has been.
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Chub says you're fired.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
You think so.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Yeah.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Shit.
No, I mean whereabouts.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Open the door. We're late.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
I guess they're stupid.
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
I called Mommy.
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Could be.
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
I still don't understand --
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
It's nice.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Can --?
Hold on!
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
You and me.
Crawl!
No shit.
Huh?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What about her?
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
Alice... I...
Got it.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
To swear you in as President.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Roger.
Dead.
A secret service agent. It must be.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
That was war.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes?
Flying the plane.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
You mean...
Set!
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
I mean for Ted.
Roger.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Certainly.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I love you.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
Uh-huh.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
You promise you'll write.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
I like my horizons narrow.
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
And still it fits?
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
Your mother mates out of season.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
In the other man's rectum.
Please, I must get out here.
Nothing.
How potent?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
You?
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
See you soon.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
That's the plan.  My word on it.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Now, wait a second --
Proceed inside.
They're but off!  Do something!
Yes, Hicks?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Sure, Hicks.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Just get back here!
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Gone.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Yes.
No.
In a harem.
What's that?
Oh!
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Don't bother!
What??
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
You have leave to try.
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
I want to go back to Vienna.
Yes!
Do you think that's funny?
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Tish-I'm-tee.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
What does she want?
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
I heard voices.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
He's terribly busy, sir.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Then he didn't send you?
I see.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Tonight?
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
Why you?
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
He's doing his best.
In three months! Papa.
Adorable!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Sire.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Enchanted, Madame.
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Yes, Sire.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Ah, love again.
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
He's here.
Don't you have a maid?
How is your financial situation?
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
How many?
This one will.
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
Bene.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Yes what?
In there, sir.
I don't know. He has pains.
Where?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
Do you have a daughter?
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
No, please.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
With the tenors.
Yes!
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
What do you want?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
I regret it is not too familiar.
Did you try?
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
No? Was Mozart a good man?
My son, no one can speak for God.
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Italian?
He's setting that play to music?
Never mind.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
I agree, Baron.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
How did he look?
Dr. Hirsch?
What did he say?
Yes.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
I expect you shortly.
That's not really a very proper question.
Yes, go on.
That's easy enough.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Lovely.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
Right.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
What time is it?
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
That's a wolf's head.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
No, but he was on the moors.
It's circling us.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
Nurse!
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
A monster. I know, I know.
What do you think?
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
No.
We'll find him, not to worry.
Yes - sure
How much?
Yeah.
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Yes, sir.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
What about?
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
I haven't got it.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Well
Don't you know?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
Good for you. Come on.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Now?
Got a handkerchief?
I'm feeling fine this morning.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
The theatre?
All right. Send him in.
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
What are you talking about?
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
Yes, sir.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Hardly.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
wasn't anywhere near this place
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Yes.
Then where were you?
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
I ain't done --
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
What's going on?
I got three.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
I got us through the War all right.
That's it.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
I'm thinking...
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Ah.
Cole, he didn't mean that.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Ma.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
And we're good at it.
You've killed your fair share of men.
We're doing this for Ma.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Yeah.
Yeah, Jimmy?
They're making him a hero now.
Can't argue that.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
You're sick of my company?
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Last February?
Damn.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
Right here in church?
And the same age Web was. No.
You been with a girl ever?
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
THEN WHO DID?!
What, sir?
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
It's going to be a long winter.
Can't you tell me anything?
In English, Pinkerton.
Yes.
Is it a what?
Turn the light on.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Take it off.
Why?
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Alright.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
I'm just leaving.
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
No.
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
It's just not.
No, you...didn't?
Lucky, I guess.
It looks so soft.
Commes des Garcon.
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
See you then.
Just...say...no.
Ye-es, Je-an?
Can you bring Mr...
No, not really.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Jean? What?
Where are you?
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Don't tell him you're here.
Who?
No.
It's no problem
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
I know. I'm sorry.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Oh.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Not in the mood, I guess.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
And?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Al.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
You don't wanna move, do you?
...But?
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
You saved my life in alot of ways.
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
I don't think he knows how.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
I'm sure.
The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Oh. Yeah.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Gary?
Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Show me.
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
Who can we trust?
What about "60 Minutes."
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
What? Come on. Is it serious?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
You may.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
Thank you, Exposition.
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
There's one more thing, Austin.
Carnies.
Be careful!
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I beg your pardon?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Do I make you horny?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Not now, Austin.
Indeed.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Likewise.
Are you crazy?
Don't worry!
Behave!
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
What are you saying, son?
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
An evil petting zoo?
Show me.
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
Did you ever...
Did you ever want to?
I love you, Vanessa.
No, he's really evil.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
There are limits?
Hope...
Have we met?
As you see.
People, too.
Ropes?
Next assignment?
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Ring?
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
For a man in my position --
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
June, July ... August?
Small talk.  Try the weather.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
No idea who. No idea why ...
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Anyone particular in mind?
Guilty until proven innocent?
Where?
This way ...
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
I was at Harrow ...
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
You are, and it's behind you.
What do you mean?
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
I love that car.
Mr. Thomerson.
I'm going now, Cole.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
I hope those guys are all right.
Any time, Al.
What are you talking about, asshole?
That's more like it.
Let's have a toast.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I'll take some.
Milt?
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Mrs.?
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
The best table in the house.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
That's the old Rick!
I'm proud of you, lad.
What's with her costume?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
I don't know.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
It works.
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
Shut up!
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
That's a dumb thing to say.
Hey, do I know you?
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Trychticholorate.
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
I need another one, sir.
See you Monday. Sir.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
What?
But he killed these guys.
Are you going public with this?
No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
Fire.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Yeah.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Four months?
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
No need to be modest, Brian.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
He treats you okay?
I treated you better.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
Putty? On both doors?
He works for me.
You like everybody, Ronald.
Nobody cares, Ronald.
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
Investigator...
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
Yes.
Me?
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
All right. What are you gonna do?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
This psycho can.
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
Did he gots to be.
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Let's go NIGGERS.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Meaning?
Manray needs a job.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
Some tap dancing, some singing.
You have to start getting into your character.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
I want to speak with you.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
How did you end up here?
So he drank himself into a stuper?
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
What do you want me to say?
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
That's why it will be so much fun.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
Hi, Mona.
Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
In time.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
What do you mean?
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
The one with da big...
Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
...no, she didn't...
...like fried and chicken...
You slept too near where you got in?
How be dat?
Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
A song a comin' I feel.
Just a little something' somethin'.
Maybe you need to start.
We can look out for ourselves.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
Say what, Manray?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Good morning.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
O'Grady.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
But how, sir?
Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Yes?
Yes, he's fine.
The milkmaid's daughter?
Dark Valdez.
Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
It's... too slow.
They're dead, aren't they?
Tell me about them.
That'd be my reaction too --
Yeah --
The creek bed --
Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Why?
West's. Any kindling for afire?
Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
But you didn't.
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Well?
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
And the problem is you only got three.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Nevertheless --
What the hell are you talking about --
You're drunk --
I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
You're right. We should sit in silence.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
I plan to grow on you.
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
That bugs you too?
You mean the falsely accused?
Think it'll work?
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Isn't this how your story goes?
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Think it'll work?
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
Sir, yes, sir!
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Yes!
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
Fine, I will.
I brought it.
A pleasure.
Well, she... uh...
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
Okay.
Beats me.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Really.
You know where the chemicals are?
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
Really.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
Yes.
That's because most of it never happened.
Mmm, what?
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Is he going to be okay?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Do you know who that is?
So you never bought any land.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
What for?
Such as?
What do you mean?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
He says he feels safe here.
Good. 
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
Leave her alone.
Right. Okay. Good.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
Well as it turns out I did.
So you're just going to be vindictive
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
You don't want to talk about it.
And. It's wrong.
And who says what is wrong.
Sometimes.
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
I got what I paid for.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Because it was a lie.
It's what you came back for.
Tell me about it.
You hurt it?
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
You sayin' you'll do what?
Don't need none.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Let go of me...
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Now, hold up.
Nuh-uh.
Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
I didn't start this, R.L.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
This all looks wonderful.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
I do.
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Ronnie...
The hell are you talkin' about?
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
The hell you call me?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Charlie...
Saving your life.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
Yeah...
Ichiro --
Good.  Very good...
You can trust me.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
It's illegal, Nick.
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
I don't know.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
Unavailable.
I need someone to translate for me.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Tell them I'm not.
The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
Why me?
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
You trust me?
Pris?
Nexus - 6.
Of course not.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
He's not ready yet.
Tomorrow, he says.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Yeah.  I got it.
How do I stop one?
Let's hear it.
These aren't just...
No rust?
Meaning?
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Too old.
Do you recognize any of them?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Are you for real?
It's a good job.
Why not?
I've already got more help than I need.
I'm sorry.
Can you?  I couldn't.
You did?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
Like?
You mean a woman?
What?
What's up?
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
Five, maybe six.
Discreetly.
I'm tired of this.
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
I don't have one.
What about friends?
Yes?
You like it?
How do you do?
Young man, stop right there!
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Yes, I'm right?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
It was amazing.
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
I know a short-cut.
I can't, it's yours.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
I think it's the eyes.
Why doesn't it never work out?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
It does?
Two weeks.
Of course.
Yes, ma'am!
In the house?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
May I please be excused?
Uh...yeah.
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
I'm sorry.
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Thanks.
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
Neat. Goodnight!
...I do.
Nothing.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Your mom made that all by herself.
No kidding!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
I love Lucy!
She's right?!
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
I just don't want to.
No.
Almost all of them.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
What?
You don't look thirty-five.
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Gladly.
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Are you in trouble, son?!
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
A psychiatrist?!
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
All back East.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Good god.
You bet, hon!
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Then after that it's safe.
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Mutants?!
We stay down here.
Some time.
Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
I see "elegant."
That's what I'm sensing.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
What do you think, Adam?
No.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Those sluts!
To bed.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
You did? A human ear?
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Jeffrey.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
No way.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Yes.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Yes.
Frank would open you.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
Yes.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
You look beautiful to me.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Mommy's here.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
I don't want to go.
This is it.
What?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Am I bothering you?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Oh, okay, can I call?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
You didn't tell him about me?
Just some fatherly advice.
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
The Duke?  What did you do?
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
Right.
me up the...
Ass!
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
A bit.
Yes, we are.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Can she I.D. them?
You killed my... my...
Male or female, bitch?!!
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
Why was I not informed of this?
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
I...
We promise.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
Well, I'm sold.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Yes.
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Yes.
Right. The blond guy.
Dignan, it's --
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
This is he?
Would they do that?
What do you think the cops have?
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
That sets it off.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
That's not bad.
Hang on a second.
Just turn right here.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
We got it. We got it.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
What do you think?
What about them?
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Hi.
They don't?
This was in fourth grade.
Yes... It's true.
Maybe he just went to the store.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
I know.
Shut up!
Let me feel that.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
You're all clear.
Roger.
We all set?
Good. It's supposed to be.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
I'll see you there.
The grandfather clock?
Nothing.
How big is it?
How?
What?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Thanks.
Grammar.
How'd he do?
Exactly. Woah.
Yeah. He said that.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Jesus Christ! No.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
No.
Who's got the car keys?
You're Anthony?
Feel this.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
There were more than that.
It's registered in my mother's name.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Yes, I do.
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Let's go!
Wait a second --
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
He said what?
Hand to hand combat?
Well, I think --
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
Right.
Mr. Henry?
Good to know you, John.
What?
Nice to meet you.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
And the Landy woman?
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
I'm sorry, Ward.
What do you have, Danny?
Okay.
You killed them.
-- what? --
-- take the back -- get another car --
No. There's nothing new.
-- it hasn't been two years --
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
So when was I here?
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
-- the hotel -- how far? --
Is there. Is all there.
Still...
And why is that?
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
He will. I know he will.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
I will not.
A patriot!
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
You are. And I'll come again.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
I'm not just saying it!
...Tonight!
How do you know this?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
Who would do such a thing?
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
So what did you find.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
I... I don't remember.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Where are my goddamn books?
I thought you were a December baby.
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
Not if you remember my dad.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
I know, but...
I dunno.  Just being weird.
Go on. Sit down.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Why's that?
Yeah?
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Kayleigh? What happened?
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
What happened?? Where are we?!
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
I thought I was the bad guy!
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
I should have known.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Oh, yes.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
I won't.
I'm awfully sorry.
It's not for sale at any price.
Suppose we do.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Practically no one.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
You needn't be concerned about me.
Occupied France?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
We said "no questions."
Yes?
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
No.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
No, Victor, there isn't.
Thank you. I try.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Yes.
Yes. What is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
And that is?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
And if it should change?
Find one.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
I was misinformed.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
What friend?
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
There seems to be no secret about that.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
He'll double what I pay you.
Then don't have a drink.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
Fix raft first.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
They're on autopilot.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
Shut up.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
And for you --
You want to.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Yes there is.
I would never --
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
No.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
I'm doing fine.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
You fucked us over.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Forget it.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
Time I had lots of.
What?
Deep, real deep.
No sweat.
Permission granted.
No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
You cook very well!
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
Nothing.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
Yes, I *have*!
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
No. She was an immigrant.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
You still doin' it too fast!
Is it true?
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
In other words, scurvy.
You do it then.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
I don't need your gratitude.
It's just my heart.
Almost.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Know who I am, Jake?
The Anti-Christ?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Come on...
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
So what? We just stay clear of him.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
Eight A.M. flight.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
I think two million.
Stake you?
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
Come here!
I think I just broke my hand.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
You interested in a little work?
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
Did I miss something?
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
No, I want my cut!
Miles...
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
We're getting a little old for running.
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
With identification.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Eee Oott Auught!
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
My car's in the garage.
What are you talking about?
My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care.
Looking forward!
South African women are very sporty.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
How's that football story corning along?
You want me drunk?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I want to hear it.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
Gambling's not about money.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Don't let yourself down.
I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
Your father?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
The point is, they want a man inside.
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
No, forget it. The bet's off.
What for?
I have to take the car.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Jack! It's Jani.
Who did it? Tell me!
I might.
Turn left at the lights.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
And the girls?
Rough life, Jack.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
I was at Beadles.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
I make it six.
Yes.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
No.
Fine.
Right, that checks out here.
What flickering light?
The key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
But how do you know you exist?
Yes, well...
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I'll check it.
Which one?
Any of 'em any good?
Out where?
Who cares?
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Negative effect.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
Leave.  Now.
You mean until you showed up?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Same old story.  Not interested.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
Are we in some kind of trouble?
There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
I'm not a half bad cook.
It was open.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
The other ones?
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
What's in it for you?
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
None.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
Right here someplace.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
Got a pencil?
A fog bank.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
You get it when I get her.
But I'll take a rain check...
How'd you get her out of town?
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Huh?
Who's Whiskey Dick?
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Yeah.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
YO, DOOFUS!
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Uhh... nothing.
That's it?
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
GOOD MORNING!
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Theoretically.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
You know what? I think that you did it.
Who is... we?
That's easy. Antiseptics.
Wonder where we'll be then.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
I'm going home.
What?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey. You OK?
Where is she?
Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
That is a terrible nickname.
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
Yes.
What else do you think about during school?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
The good stuff.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Frank is going to kill.
Guess who wrote it?
Congratulations.
Gerald.
Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
You're not a bitch.
Kitty...
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Not Vanity. He's a homo.
Where is she?!
She's right over there.
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Oh-yah.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Okay.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Yeah...
Hi.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Shut it up, Loretta.
What?
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
Becky was my only shot at state!
That's enough!
Uh, Gladys?
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
And wear a crown and everything.
And everything.  He should be king!
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
"My dear"...
"My dear President"...
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
Yes -- why?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
'At's-a fine.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
What did you say to her?
Anything else? 
Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.
I can't do it right away.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
Give me that again!
You upstart!
Bah!! 
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
WHAT  ?
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
The king can do no wrong!
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Well, these things take time.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
What is it?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Yes sir.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Good! How is the patient?
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
I don't understand.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
Please do.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
No, but I certainly shall.
Of course! You want out?
Yes.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
My... name is...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
Yes.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
No, John, not one that I can see.
Fine.
Yes... Yes, let's go in.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
And who might you be, sir?
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
WELCOME?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
And I thought you said it was something special...
I'll bring it back.
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
A lot of people like our singing.
What about the raping?
You don't love ME.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Aaagh! Rape!
Oh, thanks.
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
Find it... AND cross it!
What?
Very deep... usually...
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
She got me thinking...
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Well, come on!
But how could he know... unless...
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
She MUST have a knife or something...
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Can't make enough swords!
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
Tell him I'm coming!
Yes, Mum.
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
I told you that later.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
Okay, I guess.
Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
Oh. So...
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I don't really know how --
Okay.
This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
Frost?
It's pretty.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
No.
Okay.
I don't think we're ready.
Oh?
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
Is that what you want?
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Hey, Joel --
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
I just got in.
Long day thinking.
I'm like a joke to them.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
That's your look for me.
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
I'm glad you called.
Yeah. Cool.
Very cool. Trippy.
Sorry. I just --
I better do this, Stan.
Where?
Hell no.
Happy. Happy with a secret.
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Then why did you ask me?
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I have a family, Mary.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Then check the connections.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
Well.... er...
A job for me?
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
Don't start with me, Cooper.
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
Will it work?
What?
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
What about the accumulator...?
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
We'll make it.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
Nothing. It's nothing.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
There's no one here, Skipper.
Frozen.
Peters...
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
I don't know.
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
The "Other Place," what is that...?
Don't... don't do this...
They're gone.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
Keep your eyes open.
No. It was someone else.
Stay here! Don't stop working!
Yes.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
I did.
Not according to the computer.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
She's not ugly.
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
1000 meters...
Picking up magnetic interference.
Decompression wouldn't do that.
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
Is it safe?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Solid.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Yeah, nine years straight.
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Reed?... Sue?
Give me a mirror...
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
So are you!
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
I though we went over this.
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
Now.
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
And if he's not...?
Showtime.
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
What? What do you mean you --
If it happened to him, then it could...
I'm sure I can come up with something.
What in the world would give me that idea?
Of course. Of course.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Ben did this.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I understand the business reasons.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
On the ledge?
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
No. I want my money back right now.
Well... it's true.
I don't know. I was just curious.
But your face did!
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
No.
All right, then. It's your secret.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Yes, sir.
Ugh.
Leave me alone.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I know it's yours.
We've got to get an abortion?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
It's definitely your mama.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
Fine. Get lost.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I thought he was out of town.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
What's the big deal?
You'll always remember your first time.
Thanks a lot.
What?
He's not coming.
Yes.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Thanks. So do you.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Not down in my parts.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Jesus.
Plans?
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
Extract of pineal!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Yes!
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Her fella.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Come on, come on.
Well, justice is funny.
There's a tunnel.
Fuck you too.
The door... on three.
We gotta try.
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
What's in the back?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Oh.
Sure.
Huh?
He shot you the other time.
Fully.
Four door?
Two.
Keys.
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
I'm sure.
Amazing you made it this far.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
And the last one is the...
Not without you!!!
Let's lock off this room.
Oh...
I'd love to.
Um, well...
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
'Forgive'...? For What?
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
I guess so, sir.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Where's Clifford?
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
Fired?
Dick, we need some time apart --
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Dick...
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
Really?
No.
I know.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Daddy!
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Whattaya mean?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Yeah.
Eight stories.
Harry... I met someone.
You're telling me.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
What for?
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
I took the early rounds.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Huh?
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
Well... you're looking well.
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
No.
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
But I want to. I'm trying!
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
Don't I know you?
I don't believe so.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
It can't be as bad as that.
Worse.
How did you find me?
There is something I want.  A friend.
I will not! Kill me now!
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
I wish to be your wife.
Only you.
Not as weak as I.
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
It is
Aye, Captain.
Oh God.
As a march hare.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
For what?
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
Philosophical?
Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
I'm... dying.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Creature? A... human like creature?
Right! Right!
I finished the boats.
You're right. It makes no sense.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
It sounded like Brenda.
I had to.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
Good call.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Best over...
Girls can't be cowboys.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Thank you, son.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
He's my son.
On the dresser.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Didn't like it, did ya?
You won't let him touch her?
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
He backed down.
In other words, no.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
No!
Sure.
Yes.
I'm really sorry.
Daddy's dead.
I would say that's a very safe assumption.
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Gotcha!
Do they have a waterbed?
I'm gonna go get the money.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
All I'm saying --
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
No, I didn't.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
What?
That's what you look like.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
Don't say my name.
Really, I have no problem with --
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Sir...
I ain't gonna shoot her.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Did you hear?
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Sounds familiar.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
"G.I. Jane."  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
I'll try anyway, sir.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
I saw an article...
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
Mighta been civilian.
Educate her, Pyro.
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
I think you're the liar.
Say again?  How many micks?
MOVE!
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
Where's Audrey?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
What else do you know about it?
Are you sure?
Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
Really? I'd like to find out.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
What?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
I don't think so.
Me too.
Allez, allez!
Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Why are you telling this to me?
Why do you need that?
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
It's okay. I know her.
Where are you?
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
I'm... I'm shot.
I won't and nothing you say-
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
The guy is terminally selfish!
All this from watching the.. historical records?
Nobody was WATCHING?
What?
Yes you did.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
Excuse me guys.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Okay, that's where you want to be.
What do you mean?
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
I never get tired of that joke.
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
Your last name.
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
I think he just likes pointing at things.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
I don't know.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Former Commander?
Well... Sort of...
A model, only as big as this.
But... Inside, I have seen-
But...Why?
I think we're going to exit the space port.
What kind of signal?
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
And a French alliance?
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Same old story.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Well... I misunderstood, then.
Yes, general?
You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work.  You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want...
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Yes, my lord.
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
A fleet?
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
I think I heard that.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Yessir!
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
I'd throw everything away for you.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
He's around someplace.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
I can't do it.
It's a different kind of deal.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
That's correct. Look at me.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
I like it here.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
That's not bad.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
Compass.
Who told you that?
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
That's right. Three percent.
Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
What do you think?
There a part in it for you?
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
You're as bad as Harry...
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
You don't act like it?
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Pick 'n' Save.
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Chili and me.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
Lemme see.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
Maureen?
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
What is it?
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
How much longer's that gonna take?
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Goddamit, Dodge.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Murphy.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
What?!
Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
Don't fall asleep.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Probably didn't have time.
Because of the gold.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Nope.
So what did happen?
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
The guy. He just came this way.
There's somebody else on this boat.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
No. I'll try again later.
Only something must've gone wrong.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Maybe it was more than that.
So you killed them?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Of course they did.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
Alright. I'll be right up.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
Yeah.
You're up late.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
No, really I --
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.
Well, yes...
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Help me what?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
So, where's "Weird Al"?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Why not?
Okay... I promise.
Are you ready to go?
Shut up!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
What? Why?
He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
Good.
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Not really...
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
I didn't get it either.
Everybody's too stupid!
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
What are you talking about? Who?
Nothing.
When was this?
Great...
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
That's okay...
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I know it's over, asshole, I --
That's not even --
That tape sucked, by the way!
I'm so sorry if you were offended!
Yes.
I did too!
Later, "Dude".
Five hundred.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
How can you be so sure?
Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
What's up?
What's the matter?
Do you have anything to drink?
What about this?
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
I hate sports.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
I have no idea - I just want to...
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Did she say that?
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
We have hunted since childhood.
That is correct.  Nothing.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. 
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
So that's what a lion looks like. 
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
You give me hope, John. 
You've known him long?
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
Once... 
Four should do it.
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible. 
Hold your son high. 
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
Command me, lord.
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
Do it!  Just do it!
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Wonder what?
I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
It's in the stars.
Like a used car salesman.
I know.  It happened by itself.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
No kiss?
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Really!  Is it gone?
Talk to my accountant. 
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
I don't believe in luck.
Thank you.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
Yes.  I don't like this.
What on earth gave you that idea?
What is it?
You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
You talked to Gozer?
Life is just a state of mind.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Anything!  Just make contact.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
What?  What popped in there?
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
And the seas would boil ...
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
You're coming back?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Gladly Caesar.
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
I'm serious.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Take grain away from the army?
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
Jerses -- tomorrow...
I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
My loyalties... were in doubt.
That's what worries me...
Why do you play at being drunk?
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
Well, we can try...
Well, they die for it!
I was summoned.
Greeks?
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
Death is a very light thing for you.
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Yes.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
Wait a minute.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Yes.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
I'm glad.
Because I want to know what's happening.
That woman. The older woman.
You mean the one who --
GET OUT!
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I've never been to it.
-- really incredible --
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
My belt.
Oh.
But Elaine --
I don't see how we can.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Carl who?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Where did he do it?
Hello -- who is this?
Not exactly.
What?
Who screamed?
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Could I make one phone call first?
I'm in the bathroom.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
Please.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Right.
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Yes.
Very well. Thank you.
A drink? Of course.
I haven't. No.
Well -- goodbye then --
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Either one will be fine.
This is all terribly wrong.
Are you afraid of me?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute.
Oh my God.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Is it?
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
See if you can guess.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
Do you remember the make of the car?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
But it's not.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
How?
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
What the hell have you done?
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
When I go off?
But I don't want you to make up something.
You believe me, don't you?
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
No -- they don't.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Thank you.
I know.
What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
No, I don't.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
You miss the point.
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
Why?
I'll pay you back.
No -- why? -- should I?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Chasing what?
Anything for you.
Am I quite strange to you?
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
Just for a minute then.
You are beautiful!
That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. 
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
Really?
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
Very early in the morning.
For Vienna?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Ready, Baron.
All right then.
You've lost everything?
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Yes -- but the audience.
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
Good heavens. What for?
No, Doctor.
Send his bags up to my room.
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
No - absinthe.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
What?
I got ten marks for that.
What brown hands you have.
You're a little too fast.
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
...weight into the balance...
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Nothing.
Well?
I must go to England -- at once.
Baron!
Here, hold up!
All right.
We did not approach you.
Yes --
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
Take them back, Suzette.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
Go away -- go away.
You're discharged.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son --
My son was in the hospital --
No.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
You know it, Lilly.
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
Goody!
Not much time.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
You know who I work for.
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
Just trying to help, Lilly.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
I can't. I just left home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Look at me.
Roy? It this all we have?
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I've heard the name.
And when he got serious?
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
I saw her.
She didn't see you, in other words.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
I'm happy the way I am.
) What?
That's natural.
Gun?
Ate the gun. Oh.
Not many.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Well, when you put it that way.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
I can be real stiff.
Charming.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Would somebody shut this guy up?
Checking out your place.
My life is a living hell.
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
I can't afford to get caught.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
What are you looking at?
Never.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Can't you?
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
You stay away from him!
Kara, no!
Or what's left of him.
An old friend.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
I suppose.
Can I have the Cadillac?
I'm liable to find anything!
Go home!
You ever own a motorcycle?
First Nagasaki--now this.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
When?
In what way, pray tell?
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
The posies are for her?
Our pleasure.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
Thank God!
Sir?
Do you know who Wanda June is?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
I don't know.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Will you go to bed?
The smallest thing I've got.
Leave a tip.
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
Disease?
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
We all are.
Say hello to your mother.
It's so--so stark.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
People don't use that word any more.
What then?
Fish can't feel.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
And no one's there now?
What are you going to do?
Why not?
He cried.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
Blue soup?
Sounds quite beautiful.
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
You startled me.
He's dead, you know.
Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
None.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
King Arthur.
Cut me open.  Find out.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
You're too modest.
Was I ever of use?
I'm utterly satisfied.
If you want to be found that way.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
New lives begin!
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
She did?
How horrible.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Don't!
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
No.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Keeps fairies away!
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
Is he coming home?
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
You figure!
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
You were wonderful.
We've got to rescue him.
I believe in miracles now.
Phooey.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
Yes, we do.
No, just not the type.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
No, I don't.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
No.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Of Joanne's?
Jesus.
Is that the way it was with you?
No.
Not very.
Tijuana.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Shit.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
I can't tell you that.
Where is he, Niki?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
Who made it?
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Do the police want to arrest me?
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Just leave me alone.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Where does he hang out?
Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
What you got in mind?
I want to meet Ratan.
Who told you about this?
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
What exactly do you have in mind?
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.
Hello.
Wait here.
Oh, look! The birds.
Sort of.
Maude???!
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
It goes on and on.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
I don't know. Just one of those. 
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Of course.
Okay.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Yodeling?
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Yes.
I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
"And this too shall pass away."
What?
Perhaps it is.
No. My uncle.
Just give me a rough estimate.
Fifteen.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I wouldn't say "benefit."
Your studies?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
I knew you'd come.
You knew?
It's coming.
What do you mean?
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
Nonsense, I...
Steve...
The Cenobites.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Did he, now?
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
We're on the move.
I wish I could be more gracious but --
Those things never work. Never.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Father's back?  Still angry?
Goodbye.
Hey. You: think twice --
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Not hungry.
What about you?
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
I don't remember.
You remember.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
Frank --
Hurting.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Don't you care?
There's very little I can do about it.
Sure.
The keys are in the kitchen.
The best part of ten years.
No. I'm not.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
I'm here.
O.K.
Don't go upstairs.
That depends.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
What's wrong?
I won't be a moment.
Daddy?
You'd like the house.
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
Kitchen's through on your left.
Sure.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Gone?
I don't believe it.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
I'm coming!  Sleep well.
It's late.
If there's a train.
We're not all frigid.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
We can take your car.
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Terrific.
What the fuck is that?
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Ooh.  Drag.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
NO--!
Nothing.
Bullshit.
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
A couple blocks!  About six!
We work there!
Why?
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
Oh, hi.
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
Uh.  That's me.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
What do you mean, four more?
Nice friend.
What's his name?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Fine.
I want a tape.
It's Vince and Justin.
Hi.
I don't know.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
You won't like it.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
We'll talk some other time.
Great... That's great.
You do, huh.
You don't ever think about other people?
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
What about Ian?
Okay.
Want to know what, exactly?
You know the difference.
Oh, great...
Enough of what?
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Everything go alright?
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
Well call her mother.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Sixty.
Seventy-five.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
No, we...
Fuck off.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
I've been to Church Hill.
Not your concern.
You've been listening to rumors.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
When you finish, what then?
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
That's impossible.
Why are you here?
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
I didn't kill the watchman.
Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to.
Not power.  Not control.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
You're a long way from Inverness.
It is less.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Muy Bien!
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
I feel hardly nothing.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
It's all we have.
You're wrong.
Romirez is dust.
Not likely.
Where did you learn that?
Your father must be smart.
You'd think he'd had practice.
He knows I'm here.  How?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
Not so long.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
And if I refuse?
Yes.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
American.
Your murder weapon?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
His only kid.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
What's the idea of locking this?
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
But --
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
I'm sure you haven't any.
Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
Hello, Bruce...
Out some place.

Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
You haven't seen anything yet.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
The money? Why?
You'll ask me to what?
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Out of the mouths of babes.
Hello, Hildy!
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Sure you can. Come on.
I know, Walter, but I --
Where'd you meet this man?
The insurance business?
Now you got me.
Thanks.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
What do you mean?
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
What tricks would I pull?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
What tickets?
Is he coming back here?
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
I'm finished.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Is this the Community Hospital?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Will you come here?
Murder, uh?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Flip a coin.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
You got plenty of money?
What?
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
If there was any way out...
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Now what do you say?
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
I was just going to!
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
I'm telling you!
I'll go right after it.
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Here!
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Well, maybe you think I could!
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
The what?
Pinkus.
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
Come on, fellas.
We want to see you.
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
Why?
Very well, Grandpa.
No, she didn't.
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
Well, for the baby, really.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
A bit too quick.
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Except the servicemen.
I will if you will!
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
It looks....foreign.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
Why didn't they say that before you started?
What are you going to be then?
Half the time he's bluffing.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
I wish it could all have been different.
Look after yourself, Grace.
Am I? Maybe I am.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Really, that's a long time.
Cone.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Who's your Daddy!
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Yeah, I'll do something.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Way out here?
No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.
Thanks.
Here he comes.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Is that all... think real hard.
Enough talk, write.
What?
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
When?
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Rise and shine.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
You got to be fucking joking.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
That's the understatement of the year.
You find something, Georgie?
Oh, right.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
Shit... fuck procedure.
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
Right.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Oui.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
You are sweet.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
I just want to talk.
I've got some things to tell you.
God, you're beautiful.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
It's okay, Puff.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Always. Ow.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
My brother is discreet.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
My brother says he likes you, too.
Oh?
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
And I think I'm going to.
Shut up, you.
No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
My God! The fork! The fork!
Nathan!
Of course.
What SPF, sweetie?
Yes.
That's very funny.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
I have to think! I have to think!
You are an animal.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
Have you?
Oh boy!
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Yes.
Lila...
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
Yahoo!
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Unka unka unka unka unka.
No.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Yes.
You want a chaser?
Do we need words?
You tell me.
Thank you.
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Yeah? Why?
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
What's that supposed to mean?
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
I don't know.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Eddie...
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
I asked around.
Talk to me, Charlie.
He thinks I care about the money.  I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We're together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye?  You gimme the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about you.  This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames...  Excuse me...  I'll tell you what -- take her along.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Yeah, that's what I think.
A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
Okay?
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Who's he?
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
I used to be an actress.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Why?
Oh, I forgot.
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Eggs. How do you like them?
Yeah. For a little while.
Me. It's Eddie.
He knows. A lot.
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Yes, I'm glad.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
He went off someplace.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Twelve. Cross side.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
Do you want to go on?
What?
If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
Have you looked inside?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
If we want it, it is.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
Why, yes.  Why?
We were having a little talk.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Why?
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
No, but it was here.
No.
Hide the car.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
I have school.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
It's really nice of you to help us.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
David, don't...
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
I'm thinking.
You still got the Olds?
That's okay. You're driving.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
ETA with target; four minutes.
Better than we thought.
And our troops here?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
It had been deemed classified.
Yes, I am.
Butt-munch.
He's my angel.
I'm a dancer.
Oh. Sorry.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
I didn't even see them fire!
You sure?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
We should leave too.
Peace? No peace.
And I am his.
What is it?
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
It looks like a converted church.
Arghhh! Oh!
Schneider?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
Lower me down.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
I said don't go between them!
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
How do you know?
So it did.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
Thank God!
Through the library?
Right.
Well, uh...
You did!!
She talks in her sleep.
The floor's on fire! See?!
Oh.
Stop! Stop!
I was the next man.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
Thanks.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
"J".
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
Who are you?
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
You should have been there...
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Step on it, Short Round!
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Behind you!
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
Don't let it curl around you!
THE WHAT?!
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
Don't catch cold.
Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
Willie!
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
I'm not leaving without those stones.
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
So now they believe me.
You know you've been nothing but trouble since I hooked up with you -- but I have to admit I'd miss you if I lost you...
What above the curves?!
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
Don't do that.
What is your name?
Do me a favor, Al.
Yeah?
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
You are CRAZY!
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
The man.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Oh yeah, to what?
The beach?
You eat it.
Why not?
It's sand.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
No...you idiot!
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Don't get too cute.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
You get time off to sleep.
I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!
You found her.
Neither can they.
It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
While he makes the run.
I can't handle that thing.
I don't know.
I have been... I think you're right.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
Now, you're too suspicious.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I'll get us out of here.
Aren't we all.
Let us get to the border!
What a nerve!
Me.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
He's not an ordinary man.
Do what?
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Thanks, I appreciate that.
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
Yes?
Oh...I can't. Business.
...Rene.
Can I help?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Trans Ocean Travel.
How often they come here?
Why didn't you tell me?
Wanted to get to know you.
There's not much to tell.
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
I'm just on vacation.
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
We're very close.
How do you know you can trust me?
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
I've never met anyone like you.
I'll come back for you.
You're gonna laugh.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
A drink...
Why?
Could I have it, please.
Thank you.
It will.
What does he know?
What about Al...
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Yeah? What for?
Yes, baby?
There's Dad, on TV.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
I'll be there.
What? Forget it.
Good.
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
You're exaggerating!
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
Then what are you going to do?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Hey, Lowell.
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Catch ya' later.
Are you sure?
Call me back in ten.
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Yes, it's on the stove...
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Can we talk about this when I get back?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Get some perspective, Lowell.
Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!
I'll call you then.
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Give me a break!
Everything interests me.
I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
I told the truth... I told the truth.
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
What do you mean there is no family?
Where you staying now?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Seven...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
We rest, Your Honor.
Mr. Massey?
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
No frown lines.  New watch?
It was a gift from a client.
What?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Isn't everything?
I told you. I was hungry.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Thank you.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
No.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Please! Leave the house.
You were going to have this thug...?
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
You have some?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
We do have a man for you.
I'm dying.
I guess.
He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
She's here now.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
Did Marylin end up with money?
And it's good!
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
Well -- is that possible?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
And she has...?
Is she going through with it?
Maybe next time.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Oh, no, sir. No different than
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
That's an evasion.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
I don't know.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
I'm sorry you read it.
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to  as long as I can get her back. 
Lower the boats!
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
What would you like to have me do?
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
But the lady says
All right, let it go.
No.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Oh, yeah?
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
What for?
You have your nerve!  Here, boy!
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
I can't go out like this.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
You weren't so bad yourself.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
Not as long as I'm alive.
Why, haven't you?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
Yes.
That's silly.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
What?
Try me.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Clever.
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
What for?
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
What about money?
Yeah, swell.
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter
I'm out! I'm out!
Yesif he is your husband.
Isn't he here?
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Eight o'clock.
I said, the old man's screwy!
Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Thanks.
Get out!
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
What's the thousand bucks for?
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Mush. Mush.
I don't trust him.
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
I can use a smart guy like you.
Yeah ?How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
No.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
And Oswald?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
He had his palm print on the weapon.
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Calm down, Dave, what?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
No.  Never heard of him.
A Perry Russo?
David Ferrie.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
Tough day.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
Never touched me.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
Germany.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Who was there for your ass?
You were there for me.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
She almost sounds scared.
Sure.
That's my diet shit.
What's her name?
Okay.
What's your brand?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
Why?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's not really something I think about.
No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
And Annette's it for you?
I don't care.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Right around here, in the food court.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
The day you got me out of jail?
What do you do when he comes home?
Did you do it that night?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
I hesitated taking that much.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Yeah?
I know what it looks like.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
That would be one point of view.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
I have no idea.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Great...  ...Wanda!
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
You already knew that?
Kinda.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I understand woman, damn!
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
Talk to you tomorrow.
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
Yeah, I think a woman.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Where at?
The roller disco one.
With Ordell?
That sounds like a problem.
Yeah.
Does that bother you?
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Okay.
The moon -- I dunno
Uh-huh.
C'mon in.
I'm in my underwear.
What did he do?
Yeah.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
He's a big one. You two tight?
You think you could do that?
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Yes.
I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  I get my money back, don't I?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
And where's Jackie?
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
I know where it is.
Turn left.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
No problem.
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
What do you want?
Hello, Sam.
No, don't. But thanks.
Me, too.
Oh God!
LET GO!
Short? It's ended.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
But the paper ...
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
Sarah.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
I've seen it. It's all pain.
I'm walking, aren't I?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
I don't know what to say.
Hell, you think I am?
I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
New? He's been here for years.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Where is the lamp?
I moved the couch. That's all.
Jezzie, I can't see.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Jake, you are never out of your head!
What?
Why you left.
Well, you didn't marry her.
Gabe.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Why? What for?
Get your clothes off!
Am I home?
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
I know.
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
I love you when you're angry.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Oh?  Where you going?
Where are they?
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
Well that's good to know.
No. I couldn't.
Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
If you're lucky.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
That's a lie. My family was here.
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Thorgan, pull us in.
And you said high school was boring.
What are you doing back?!!
We could convert fission transistors.
Thorgan? You coming?!
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
We're screwed.
GO, GO, GO!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
You prefer an apple?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Ow!
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
I gotta go back.
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Hockey player? He's not a ...
Exactly.
It's okay.
Who's driving the boat?
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
The bilge pumps. There --
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Have you ever had one do this?
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Older, sillier.
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
No, we just checked the beach...
Let's all have a drink.
What do we do?
No shark did that to a boat!
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
We never had any. What's the problem?
What else could've done that?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
Is anyone having this...?
Is that a boat?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Yep.
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
I think I can top that, Mister...
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
What?
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Did you hear it's yours?
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
No, he's the dad.
You know... it's parts...
Hey, I like this.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Nope. We're safe.
No?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
But you're old!
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Unfortunately, yes.
That is sick, man.
Or stage parents!
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
What are you referring to?
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Karma.
That French ain't it?
...Yeah, sure.
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
You can?
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
No sir.
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
Thank god!
The party?
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
...Brian hurt his foot.
...Janitor's job.
Umm. Altogether?
Yes.
Was up bitch?
You fucked it?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
Let me smell it again.
To what? Virgins?
What do you mean?
It's no big deal, right?
The cartoon?
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Yeah.
Why I give pennies?
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Fifteen for me.
Yeah probably.
Yeah.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Hold on.
You have?
Tonight?
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
Bang up stuff.
Because, you know why. You know.
Were you protected?
I tested positive?
Yeah?
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
I know.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Yep.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
But then I won't need your money.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Hello?
I can't man.
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
You think he's dirty?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Who is this?
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
Very good.  How did you know?
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Nothing.
Thanks, David.
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
Any sign of rape?
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
No prints.
How long she been dead?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
It's important.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
I got it from the tournament directory.
It doesn't make sense.
A building?
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
"Carefully".  "Carefully". "Carefully".
When I was very young.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
We need your help.
You sound like my mother.
Of course.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
Why?
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
Then why are you backing up?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
Well, you're beautiful.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
Colwyn ...
I knew you would come.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
The Fortress moves?
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
<u>Why</u>?
But you suspect.
Yes.
Where the spiral begins.
Use your sword.
You're coming with us.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
No! You cannot know that!
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
Not sleepy, either?
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
A flicker of talent.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
It's right behind you.
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
He will not come. You will be my queen.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
But you would not stay with me.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
Knowledge.
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
...What?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.
Good.
Huh... 500 meters?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
OK.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...17.
I think.
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
A little...
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Nothing, for the moment.
Fine...
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
...Composer.
...And how much is it?
Here comes the resume.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
How serious is it?
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
You need a ride, Preacher?
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
What?
I don't follow.
Show me.
Don't be so sure.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
Yes.
That's a reasonable assumption.
Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Nine.
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
Yes.
Tomorrow.
What, come on?
Don't do this.
... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
It's mine to risk.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
It's yours.
No alcohol?
No.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
No -- S.E.R.A.
To death?
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Let's stay for a while.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
Are we done for today?
Get up.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
That's not what's important.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Yes.
That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
Yes, I am.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
I think so...
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
Delta. Gamma.
You're kidding!
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
But maybe it is --
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.
Are you asking me on a date?
What do you think?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
What?
Really --
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
Of course.
That's not entirely --
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
You go where?
What, like it's that hard?
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
Thank you. Having fun?
Now I am.
Are you serious?
Your love.
You're magnificent.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
To be my bride, of course.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
What will become of me then?
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Or looked so beautiful...
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
And who might that be?
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
It would appear so.
Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
Whatever for?
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Jack, don't!
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
There's the way, mates.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
The chill is worse this night.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
That's it!
Fire away!
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
I'm not afraid of the dark.
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
They'll do nicely.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
I'm not its master.
They tricked you.
I don't want it on me.
Oh, la...
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Then, perchance you'll me.
Only what's right...
And I... love you...
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Thought the weather terrible of late.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
Ask away, sweet man.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
I'm promised to another!
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
That very nice.
I wanna be with you today.
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
Are you his friend?
I'm living here while I build another house.
Is that legal?
What's that?
I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
He jumped into the ocean.
Yeah.
I wanted him to marry her.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
Okay.  I guess.
Floating to Catalina.
He's at work while I'm here.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
He's not the type to worry.
I flushed it down the toilet.
If that's what it takes.
Months.
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
I want you both to stay.
Thank you.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
I don't know.
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!
Why?
Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
You'll have money when you work.
It'll be fine.
The gloves on the table are for you.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
He's got nothing to do with me.
I'm telling you now.
To hide a black eye.
What's wrong with your back?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
I haven't been touched in years.
I know there's an explanation.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
You let him pierce his nose?
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
Four days.  I left to think.
I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
Why would they tow your truck?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
I love those doors.
The garage.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
One of you would end up dead.
I drove over and you were gone.
Let's go.
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
You got the money?
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
You can't go because of Sam?
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
I know.
I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
Hey.
Depends on what I'd give up on.
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Cost you a pair of nylons.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
I'll be right back.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
No, tell me what's so funny.
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
Still got that ten dollars?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
Claude.
What do you want, Claude?
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
The hell you talking about? What train?
I can't eat it with mustard.
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Whatever.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
I try to moisturize regularly.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
Like you shot Winston Hancock?
Me? Willie Long.
I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
He's sick?
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
Absolutely not.
And he's dead serious.
It's just such a slap in the face.
...their damned souls will be ours.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
All right. Let me out.
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
Yeah, you do...
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
Yes, Jimmy.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
Boogerland!
The Dark Prince is here.
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Dude. Seriously?
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
You think I'm a tourist?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
Sometimes, sure.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
..."The Devil?"...
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Where do you send them?
You're a beautiful pair.
It'll be all right...
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
When do you go up?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Sad? What made you sad?
You felt sad. What's your name?
Jessica.
No.
Not about that.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
Uh-uh.
I have.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
But what is this -- why?
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
I -- I can't.
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
Don't ever let go.
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
Yes...
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
Hello.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
What makes you think so?
Alive?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Good... You up for a drive?
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Okay.
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
Yeah.
Maid? Relative?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
Or not so recently?
Ours, Ed.
I used to.
What deal?
What's he do?
Pete... Don't...
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
Okay.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
What night is that?
Yeah? what did they want?
When he went to work, right.
Pete, what happened to you?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
A videotape.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Thanks, guys.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
Was there?
They're gonna cook him.
What'd I tell ya.
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
What?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
Yeah.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."
Thank you.
Fossils, huh?
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
Yes!
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Okay, Lovey.
They were in a quandary, and
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
In a quandary.
Gold. You were going to
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
Oh, yes.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Well, is it?
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
Yes.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Why, no.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Are you so certain you are away from it?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Hey!
Yes.
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Do you think this will come in my time?
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
I don't know.
You can't leave, George.
So you think I'm mad?
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
The clothes?
What about the others?
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
I'd love it!
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
Thank you.
Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
Yes, sir.
Actually, it didn't come from me.
Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Don't worry about it.  Four-Eyes'll run a track on him.  We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
We wear black.
So what's the problem?
I know, but we're on a college campus...
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Let's check am out.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
Gee.  You really think?
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Maybe you need a closer look.
I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.
I dunno. One?
Will it lower the curve?
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
What?
They're inside.
What?
Forget that guy --
I know... I do, too...
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Lara --
The nation votes this week...
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
The mall?
Now look at him...
Did he close the front door?
But you call this room the "temple".
Just a nickname.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
I need help with her.
All right, I'll try...
Sean --
I was looking for you...
Good-bye, Dad...
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
The precogs were wrong.
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm a little dizzy...
The what?
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
I believe in that system...
-- and then walk out.
You're insane or you think I am.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
What?
This murder is happening at two different times.
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
They're everywhere.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I think you're swell company, Knott.
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
I know who you are.
That was our apartment.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
What, sir?
Is it the good room?
All the suites are about the same.
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
As far as...?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
See you later.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
She's, uh, sleeping.
No.
What time is it there?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
Oh, please.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Ho's a good guy --
I'll support you.
With what?
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
Yeah.
That's it.
Where's Ricky.
Sure. Yeah.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I don't understand.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
You want --
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
Bobby.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Yeah?
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Thanks.
So?
I will.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
I like it.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
Pretty nice.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
How much is it?
Yeah, I guess.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Oh really. Why's that?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
How'd they know who you were?
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
Back in.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
C'mon, man...
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
No.
You did?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
Let's just go now and wait.
You're not getting a gun.
Easy...
Yeah. I want it.
The line's over there.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Watch it...
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
So you're our own private guy?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
That's none of your fucking business.
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Bet you like that shit.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
You know it.
Let Billie finish.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
Don't con me. Don't try...
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
I can't.
I don't know how.
I want to. God knows I want to.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
No, Brother Minister.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
I can handle it.
Did you hear what I said?
It will be rough.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
Let some of us come down there.
Let's cancel.
Is my family here yet?
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
You put it very well.
Entirely.
Let me do it then.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
"His greatest greatness."
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
I mean it's late, baby.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
Let me die then.
You're my father.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Might be all right.
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
He told you that?
I guess that makes you the smart one.
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[I believe you.]
[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[Her life for your life.]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
I'm here.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
I said the plan was right here.
Pinta...
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Creasy...
Time will tell.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
I go to school, don't I?
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
Don't worry. You will.
You don't drink like you used to.
You think too much?
Then be trained.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
Then don't come.
What was her name?
When?
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Hmm?
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[I think he's... magnificent.]
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
What?
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
Which one was that?
Oh, yeah.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Down there. That little one there.
I been looking all over for you!
It's early.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
When was this?
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
It pains that they should do this.
Who?
Your son Marty?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
Please...
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Are you kidding?
That's the one.
You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
You gonna die without a son.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
Hiya, Ralph...
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Okay.
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
Waddaya talking about?!!
You talked to Walt?
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
No.  Or why you should.
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
Duke Forrest.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
What?
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
That's right. We work well together.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
I think we could still have a chance.
It's possible
Our minds?
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
You're leaving tomorrow?
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
Yes, Reverend?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
Yes, that's what I mean.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Sir?
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
They can't do that to me!
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
Arterial silk.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
John Doe. The one in there. 
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Hello.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Thirty dollars.
A third party?
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
The Websters.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
The letter from John Doe.
I wish he had a family, though.
Right here. Sit down.
Well, maybe you're right.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
No.
Have you seen him?
I used to pitch.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Both of 'em?
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Sure. Mostly often.
Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Yeh.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appearand in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Good night, John.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
No, sir.
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull.  Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave it all to me!
SWAT wants to go in.
Good. I don't want to be late.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
Of course.
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
I need to get something straight first.
Am I gettin' the car?
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
No. You just do shit for me right now.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
If you say so.
Like it had to be done.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
You're a compulsive gambler?
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
COME ON, RUSSELL!
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
Pull up alongside.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
And what if you can't live with it?
You've got to decide that for yourself.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Greg.
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
If you did, you never showed it.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
Use your imagination.
Scottie...
Hmm?
His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
You let us worry about that.
What do you think would be in order?
I'll provide you with transportation.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
Someone who believes in miracles.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
It's his nature.
Who?
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
-- I saw the program.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Tanner.
Then how do you know about --
-- The inside?
Yes.
It was a test.
Way you kiss me.
What's the difference?
Sorry?!
Destination?
-- Waiter.
Resurrection.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
Stylin'!
Activating Power Beam!
Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
Where did it originate?
I think so.
THERE'S THE COMET!
A real shame.
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
You want me to place a few calls?
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
The goddamned bastards.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
Who hired the bastard?
That ain't what your mama said.
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
I was calling yesterday.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
Who?
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Ya piss like a man.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
You gotta plan these things.
And I got it all planned.
Not if they all die at once.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
What about the share.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Guess I'm just lucky.
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
What?
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Ohhh, nothing.
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
What?
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
How are you doing sweetheart?
What pictures?
Behind the books.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
Looks like it, but--
It couldn't be.
Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got Paine.  Hello... Oh, yes.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Shut up, Diz.
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Tunnel?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
You said it!
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
That infernal phone!
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
*But you never asked me*!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Ma! Hold him!
Than what?
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
I yield.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
No, Jeff--please--!
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
Jefferson--
Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
What?
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
How's Amos, Ma?
We'd better see.
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Pleased to meet you, sir.
The Steering Committee.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
Letitia.
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Saunders--
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
"So help me God."
You were about to recognize me, sir--
Ring the call to quorum.
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
Okay. See you here.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Yeah?  And what else?
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute, thought.  Let him in.
Just a minute, Joe!
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Order!
Page boys!
Deeds?
Yes.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Your Honor!
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Yes!
What happened?
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
What did they say?
What are they going to do?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Why don't you try?
Nothing
You have?
It had better be good.
I'll get my hat.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Can I have a month's vacation?
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
Hurry up!
We'll send for the police!
Mr. Cedar!
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
How do you do.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
You're going to New York with us.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Shut up!
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Why, it's an artistic institution
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Huh?
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Yes, sir.
Prairie? Oysters?
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
What two policemen?
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
How did they threaten you?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Mr. Cook.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Were you supposed to have a session?
You're the shrink, aren't you?
Right now?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
I never said that.
You are so mean.
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
I've had my moments.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
Who was that?
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
You like me. How come?
No gentleman caller, Doc.  Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening.
-- Go on!
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.
What kind of doctor are you?
Oh... not a real doctor.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
What?
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Uh-huh.
Life.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
It's all right.
Either one.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Transference.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
That's not quite what I said --
Uh-huh.
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
I've got three big ones.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Well, there's Lily.
Jerking off?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
It matters to me.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Holy shit!
You and Candy...?
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
All new people start with that...
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Yes, yes it does...
What?
When?
Well, okay then.
And how does one do that?
Excuse me?
Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you.
Sounds familiar.
'Cause I look good doin, it.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
I know my treasure.
Trust me.
The things that get you excited.
Who was talking about what?
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
What?
What --?
Head hunting.
The Disco Boys.
When was that?
But you're a superhero.
Me, too.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
Doctor Heller?
You're dead.
I'm not that kind of girl.
I saw him walk you home.
That was easy. 
Roy.
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
Monica!
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Who are they?
This looks like a job for Superman --
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
Great timing!
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
But who made this treaty?
Come back in an hour.
Let me see it.
Yes, sir, I am.
Oh -- where do you come from?
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Yes, it must be.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
No...
Not even the slightest hint of something?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Yes.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Goodbye.
Yes.
In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
Why did you give it to him?
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
I couldn't face telling you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
How do you know?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Yes, I do -- very much.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
Is he alone?
Show him in.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
That's it?
Thanks, Unc.
Yeah.
Yes you did.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
I can't taste nothing.
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Better sooner than later.
Just hold your breath.
I'll remember.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
You don't wanna know.
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
Yeah.
I don't know the number.
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
What's the matter?
Elroy.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
Yes.
You fucked up.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
Is within himself.
Keep it.
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Irene is going to help.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
Laughs.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
I kill her anyway.
Do it!
No.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
I been mindin' Pearl.
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
You have all sinned!
Yes! Yes!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
About what!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
There's something else.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
How?
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
To see Dad?
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
That's Daddy!
Dead.
I'll make coffee.
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
No. No.
What's taking you so long about it?
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
Come on, children!
I don't know nothin'!
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
Why sure, boy, sure.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
All right.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
Why, pray tell?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
Where's your Missus?
Where's she at?
The Drugstore?
He never asked me for nothin'.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Haven't slept, have you?
Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
Well what you reading it for?
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Krueger?
I will.
Mother, for petesakes.
Great
Put that damned thing down!
Dead and gone.
Go on...
The door was locked from your side.
Yeah, nuts.
Of course. What's that?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
And you too, Ninotchka.
You should. I'll show you.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Yes.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
Or it might be the firing squad!
Or we can't go back to Russia!
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
The former Duchess!
That's all right.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
Eight forty-two, sir.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Certainly.
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
If you want to see us you must come later.
Two thousand francs.
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
Me?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Please don't misunderstand me...
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
It's twelve o'clock.
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
Oh, let it ring.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Then you should go back to your table.
Probably not.
I have never heard one.
Yes.
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
A funny story?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
...and we won't clench our fist...
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Radio! What is radio?
No, no music.
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
So happy and so tired.
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
Is this your new dress suit?
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Yes, Swana, you did.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
I must insist that you leave.
In that case I can only say good-by.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
May I ask why?
No.
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
You did say it, sir.
He told me to take you to his conference room.
Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
I understand that, sir.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
I figured that out.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
So you tell Mitchell ...
And?
This is not a joke, John!
No, sir.
We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
'Night, Al.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
That smell.  I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood, General.  I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
Money.  Follow the money.
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
Is it my turn?
And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
Yes ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
So President Kennedy thought.
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
The old queen did it on purpose.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
Who do you think is behind it?
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ...
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
We have to entertain the possibility ...
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
You don't think he was a hero?
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
How about Kissinger along with him?
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts.  Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon.
That was a long time ago.
You're shittin' me.
Syracuse.
Hello ...
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
I want a divorce.
Yeah ... I'm out.
I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
No.
Hiding what?
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Lost.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Yes, you've circled round.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
No ID in her room?
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
Don't hurt no one.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Just keep it up.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Uh-huh.
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
If you knew, you would have it with you.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
No me mate.
Airport.
Well -- where ya goin'?
You know who it is.
I seen you was from Dallas.
I was just passin' the time.
I don't know. Will there?
Now. We close now.
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
I could come back then.
You married into it.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
For what?
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Okay.
No sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. I remember dates. Names. Numbers. I saw him on November 28th.
Okay. We can stop that.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
How would you describe him?
Sugar?
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
No I don't have it.
No sir.
Don't jack with me.
Yes sir. Two tours.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
...plenty
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
Tell him what you told me.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Well, do something, then, damnit!
No, I didn't have to.
What about it?
I know plenty.
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
Yes, ma'am.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
What are you talking about?
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
George...
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
I came for love...
No. Loma Vista.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
He has a wife?!
God, that's awful!
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Umm...
You still in love?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
That is so right.
Hell of a way to die.
IT SURE IS!!
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
I wanted to make a statement.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
What doesn't?
You need to remember who you're talking to...
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
Betty was a lovely child.
What do you mean?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
He's waiting...
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight...
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
Gopher, Everett?
Do not seek the treasure!
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
Not that I'm aware.
Problem a p'seption.
Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; I was makin' the larger point.
Suckin' away.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
- in the gods - Huh?
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that competition.
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
You got it, Sweet Pea.  Nice boonies, Seeger.
No, sir!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Yeah.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
There's always a choice.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
I don't want you to move.
Does it still hurt?
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
What would you do differently?
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I can't risk it.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Naw.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
God.
There is not one thing funny here.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
Th --
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
Not that one.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
They're not supposed to be here!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
Shut up and let me think.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
No fucking way.
The hell we are.
What?
Why?
What's to keep them from prying open the door?
What?!
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
Feel okay?
Shaky?
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
I saw something, I saw...
On it!
Stop it.
What?
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Oh shit Alma... you're...
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Man, fuck you!!!
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
Just a kid.
Maybe...
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
No, he takes after his mother...
As do you.
What unit?
Colonel will do.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Oh?
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
Prisoner exchange.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
No...
Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Where?
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.
It's Mister Marion.
Name five hundred.
That's five, keep going...
Gabriel.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
Four, five miles.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
Yes, he does.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Yeah, sure.
I'm sure you're not.
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
What were you listening to?
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
I think it is so, Ellie.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
Is there quicksand?
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Don't worry about that.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
That's forgotten.
Yes, I guess I do.
Louis, are you sure?
Aye, aye, sir!
You can't.  I can.
He didn't waste it.
That so?
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Thank you, sir.
It's a pirate medallion.
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
At least once more, Miss Swann. As always.
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
I said, no lies.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
You threatened Miss Swann.
No.
Because you're a pirate.
My father.  William Turner?
It's not true my father was a pirate.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
Depends.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
But --
No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Yeah, I do!
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
So, I guess it worked.
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
That's what I thought.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
What happened to it?
Yes.
The waste.
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
Did you think I could just leave you...?
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
You may go, Smythe.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
I know that.
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
You're acting like a child.
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Oh, is that so?
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
Right - for the first time this year.
Is that so?
That's so.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
No?
Your valet, sir.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
It's the smoke.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
How is her family going to feel about it?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Staring at us?
Never even been to New Madrid.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
You quit trying to stop anybody
I don't eat waffles.
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
All right, Grandma
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Yeah.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Well, sir, I putter.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Very good, sir.
No. I want to know.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
I won't.
But you can't go out there.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
I don't want to put on some make up ...
I don't want it to go away.
I'm gonna go now.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Oh yeah.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
It is?
Trust me ...
What?
I don't believe it.
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
No. Of course not.
Rain.
Still doesn't make it right.
Well--it was dark out ...
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
It's not in ME.
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Green.
What are you doing?
YOU get lost!
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
It's okay.
It's fine.
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
That's great.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
... Lover's Lane?
Rain.
No I won't. I swear.
McGinty's.
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
What?
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
BUD.
I had nothing to do with that.
Oh no? Let me show you something!
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
... Yeah.
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Yeah ...
Forget about that!
So they can have their hamburgers!
... What's that?
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
Really?
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
Yeah ...
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
And what was this?
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
That's it.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Yes.
No.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Uh-huh.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
I know I did. But I don't.
It was cool last night.
They're not open yet?
Not very well.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
It's Barry.
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
You see?
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Nothing.
Are you learning how to play it?
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Ok.
What do you mean?
Lena?
Yeah?
Yeah......yeah.....
For work.....
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
You left me at the hospital.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
I'm fine, I have your work number.
I didn't do it.
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
Thank you.
.....Well yes I do....  But one more thing I wanted to tell you guys about the new plungers is that we're making the handles now in a non-breakable material called.....
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
Fine, thank you.
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Hi, Lance.
You should go on a trip.
No thanks.
Ok.
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
What?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
You ready?
Are you coming to eat with us?
Ok.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
No one's forcing you to listen.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
Mustn't do that, sir.
It's not even noon --
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
That's enough.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
NOW STRIP.
I saw the longing in your eye --
-- that was lust --
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
A few indiscretions in his youth.
And place my reputation at stake?
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
Enough!
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
I pray you: be succinct.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
....shame on you, truly...
I'd rather read, thank-you.
No, when I was but a tender lad--
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Mm.
I can't
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
I'll remember that.
Bel Air is restricted.
Yeah
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
How much?
I am not that woman.
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
You are repellant when you drink.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
I don't want you to--
Huh?
A delicious amalgamation, is it?
No -- no -- I mean--
He personally asked you to?
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Right-
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Listen to me-
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I'm sorry.
I don't care.
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
Again.
Pardon?
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
None of your fuckin' business.
Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
You know, like bang her or anything?
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
No, I just told you what happened.
What?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
No.
It's OK.
Who asked you?
No, I'm not.
You asleep?
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
You're hurting my arm.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Jefferies?
For instance?
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
All right -- you don't believe me.
Thanks.
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
A detective's nightmare.
Mrs. Thorwald.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
Like what?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
That's normal.
I'm not ready for marriage.
No.
That's the hard part.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
Police?
You called the police?
There's something buried there.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
No.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
To bail Lisa out of jail.
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
Not a word.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Anything else bothering you?
It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
That's good news.
Make the one you want.
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Lisa! Shut up!
Three.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
I mean what I said.
So do I.
Nothing, thank heaven.
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
Maybe she died.
Someone not his wife?
It doesn't make sense to me.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
The same.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Huh?
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
You watch too much television.
Okay.
I like you, you know?
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
I'm not hungry.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
Well, now--
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
You don't want me to go.
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
You don't?
I was talking to Jim.
Are you going down there?
Come with me, John.
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
You remember me?
What?
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Come out come out wherever you are!
I'm what?  What?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
My gun?
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Chicken?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Yeah--why--
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Why?
How many rooms do you think there are?
Are you?
So do you.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Okay.
He hates me.
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Why?
Please, Gabriel, don't...
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
To all those cons...
We sell children's toys --
Thank you.
Smile.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
Yes it was all you --
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
We could live it up and --
You sold him out.
Nick --
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
We? What "we"...
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
Part of... with them?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
Yeah. That's love.
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
Yes!
Yes!
Samantha.
Where'd she drop her cherry?
Christmas... Eve...
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
You do.
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
...never... tried...
Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
What?
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Acid-chewer.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Yeah.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
I'm just saying.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
GUARD!!!
...for Christmas...
She set them up. All of them.
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Well...sorry...
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
There is no other table --
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
That I should've picked you up?
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Who?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
Yeah.
Did the two of you talk?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
What? Snap out of it!
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
What do you care?
Sorry, it's my book now.
What for?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
It's a surprise.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
I don't like alarms.
No, I'm not!
Lie back down, and try to -
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Uh-uh, just cops.
No shit?
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
This is what he was doin'.
Not these guys.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Nobody. The light was bad.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
You can stay here if you like.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
We can't stay here!
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
I don't want to run short.
In a fight?
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
How'd you happen to miss?
Good thing you didn't.
That's right, Steve.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
There's only two of them now.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
What's there to be fair about?
I'm sorry. Let's go.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Just a thing I was workin' on.
And you're all alone.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
Maybe in Sonora.
How many ways can a man say no.
No. We're not stayin' --
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
I feel good anyways.
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
You were supposed to be reading words.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Alex, what are you doing?
That's it.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
I was thinking the same thing.
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Right behind you.
Not in a thousand years.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Would you please focus?
Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
That's right.
Second best.
My help?
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Then let us prepare.
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
Get out?! What does it say?
"Fucked me."
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
But Mom, the video's not over.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
This is so silly. 
You mean for TV or print?
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
Yes, I did.
...People who don't mind their own business.
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
You bitch!
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Yes... but... I didn't...
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
There is one big problem though.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
You think my sister is there?
No.
Listen 
What circumstances?
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
I can't understand it at all.
"The Dante?"
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
She's a pretty good sort.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them.
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
But you have treated me that way.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
And Gregory -- he loves her.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
She was my patient.
Cloven hoof?
I don't know.
One believes - it's like any other religion...
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
It seems right to us.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
Yes  and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
Yes.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
I feel like they do.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Why didn't you tell me?
That's a good question.
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
Yes.
No.
You said you weren't always impotent.
That's correct.
So you have had sex.
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
No.
But you're planning to be?
Possibly.
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Why not?
Because.
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Always the lawyer.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
Yes!
Yes.
No, I didn't.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Radon leakage?
No, I haven't.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Did you find him attractive?
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
He doesn't have a phone.
Let me talk to him first.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
And... do whatever it is you do.
Will you stop? Jesus.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
Well, why?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
What kinds of questions?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
He wouldn't do that.
You don't know that for sure.
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
Nope.
Nope.
How did you find me?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Cynthia. John.
When?
Look, I'll call you, okay?
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
God, you... you're mean.
No, John, things are getting real simple.
Yeah.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
All right, jesus.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
That you, Rog?
Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Fools!
What?
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
I'd forgotten.
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Sure thing.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
I NEED SOME
It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
F for...
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
How's the trip?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
I'm good.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
That's what people say.
Oh yeah.
Good. How're you?
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
I can't help the traffic.
Yeah.
Just tell me.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Sure is tasty.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
And get your bone smooched.
I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
It's not even a mile.
Whoa.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
I want to go home now.
Nah. I want to watch this.
Right now.
Yep.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Is what the money thing?
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
What exactly are we going to do?
You have to tell me --
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
Please, Miles, please.
No, I'm okay.
You said it looked like a car accident.
Yeah.
Maya, how are you?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
Yeah, same here.
Yeah. Definitely.
What's the title?
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Good. So did I.
Victoria.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
That's great.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
You golf?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
No.
No dad!
I heard them Morgan.
Dad!
Me too.
Good.
...I will.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
Yes it was.
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
That's right.
What does it matter then?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
They already know we're here.
We have to go in the basement.
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
Oh.
Dad.
Where are we going to sleep?
Don't call me Father.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.  So he was tall?
I would say so.
Six months.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
What did you say?
My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue.  Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.
Did it seem short to you?
Sounds good.
Sure.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
McKendrick's men got him.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
Goodbye?
Didn't Paden tell you that?
This is a brutal land.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
I'll be long gone.
Not for five years.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
I expect.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
All right, you buy me a drink.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Because they don't like what I want.
All I did was kiss the girl.
Let's get out of here.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
It's none of your business.
Rae, all we got is each other.
What makes you think I could?
Luck, I guess.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
Stella.
And I know what I'm talking about.
It's the only place I'm happy.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
I'm ready for that.
I'm not --  He's not.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
Please.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Why not?
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Even the fall from the plane?
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
Of course.
Do what you do to Simone.
How about the nudity?
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Why not?
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
Simone!
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
I'm sorry.
Not like this --
What's that?
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
Really?  Too bad.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
I'm keeping it in trust.
No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
Dark?
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
--Do I know you?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
If it's okay with you?
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
I guess they don't.
You mean aneurysm.
She died a long time ago.
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
What kind of words?
I forgot myself.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Yes.
Soon. One week.
Yes, it did.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
Oh.
Anything bad about me?
Yes.
They?
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
S-ssssstop it!
Could take a little while, though.
See?
Bitch.
Not lately.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Hey. Fuck you.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
You know who I am. You invited me.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
Who? Us?!
The audience!
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Yes!
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
So?
Mmmm -- so can I...
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Whatcha' doin'?
Oh, yeah?
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
No. What?
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
You took Bill.
And this is mine.
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Don't worry, Chief.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Hey, look!
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
What do you think?
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
A what?
Eyes on the road.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Would I lie to you?
Eleven.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
Weight Station.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
See ya, Kate.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Go.
Can a pig whistle?
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
I'm cucumber cool.
Yeah, but...
Go breaker.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
Two of 'em?
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
You think so?
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I -- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
I don't see it like that at all.
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
Wow.
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
True?
Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
What else did Padiche say?
What's the time frame?
Why did you agree to come here?
You fucking bastard...
How long can you go without sleep?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
My wife.
Rheya.
Why?
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Her oxygen would have run out.
Into what?
I won't be making the trip.
I'll just be a minute.
Why?
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
Is it intelligent?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
As I said, then it's God, right?
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
You don't know?
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
He has a point.
When?  When I'm asleep?
You never said you wanted one.
I never said I didn't.
Chris --
Yes, you are --
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
I'm not Snow.
Occasionally.
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Right.  That's true.
I'm supposed to call in.
There's a phone in the car.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
No dog.
Tell it like it is.
Open the door, will you?
Are you okay?
I know.
Long enough.
So.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
My ass is falling.  It is.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Why?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Did you hear what I said?
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
No, sir...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
I know where everything is.
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?
Mom and I got plans.
She's what?
Shooting?
Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
What, want a glass?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
That's not even close.
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Mr. Jameson--
Thanks, I already ate.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
Do you mind if I come too?
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
It'll shut itself off.
Aunt May, what happened?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
I heard about Thorkel's order--
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
Like it?
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
What?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
We did not.
Is you all good Nazis?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Take it.
Twenty-five.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
Yeah.
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
It's a mouse trap.
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
What's the award?
You're teasing me again!
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
Come on, baby! Daddy's going to buy you a hunk of cheese!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
Let me alone.
No. I want to draw.
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
Says me.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
We did it.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
Okay, Price. You stay.
I called it the last time, didn't I?
Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
Give me the radio.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Fine -- fine!
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Full disruptors.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
You get what?
One minute to warp core breach.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
Left behind?
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
What do you want?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
No, I didn't know that.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
Is there a problem?
Sir, is there anything wrong?
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Underground deposit?
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
I'll handle that later.
Spock's burial robe.
Logic indicates that is the case.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
I'll go...
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Aye, sir!
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
With some on the planet...
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Yes...
... Spock...
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
You're not going in there -- !
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
And who am I hiding from?
From yourself, Admiral.
Ah.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
Our first order of business is survival.
Jim please --
Is that a poem?
Mother, go back!
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
But we can't just sit here -- !
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
He's on a build up to detonation!
How soon --
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
Let them eat static.
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Rake her.
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
I'm going down to the station.
Sensors, Captain?
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
Yes, we've been through death and life together.
I would not presume to debate you.
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Too late --
A distinct possibility.
Be careful, Jim...
Scotty, can we make it inside?
It is still regulation, Admiral.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
HURRY.
<u>WHAT</u>?
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Aye, sir.
Trying, sir!
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
Course heading, Captain?
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir.
Where must you go?
A moment alone, please.
I just wish we could cloak the stench.
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
We've done it before.
-- That's the general idea.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Come on, Pavel...
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
Then how.?
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
Like what?
The top of what?
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
We don't want to be any trouble.
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
You're upset about losing the whales.
... You're very perceptive.
Hm?
Who do you think I am?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
All right. The truth?
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
Noon tomorrow...?!
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
How do you know this...?
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Mercy Hospital.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
Humpbacked - people.?
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Just use the keyboard...
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
For someone so young.
I aspire to be more than I am.
Do machines ever play?
Bye.
Data doesn't breathe.
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
A planet in Federation space...
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
We're not waiting until morning... take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise.
I'll be in Engineering.
Options?
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
No, sir. It is a gorch.
We have to find shelter...
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
Why don't you try sitting up?
Yes...
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
Not yet.
You think they're still up there?
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
I... do not want this...
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
We're crossing the threshold!
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
You don't sound French.
The invasion plans.
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
I'm very sorry.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
You're lying.
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Onscreen.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
Agreed. Options?
Where the hell are they going?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
Fascinating...
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
We're not finished.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
No way.  You see this?
They'll make it look like an accident...
That's a comfort...
And you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
I am.
Your honors, the State rests.
I know what you mean...
But if she's cloaked...
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
And your coat.
There's a reward for your death.
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Aye, sir.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Uhura, signal our surrender.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
From Enterprise?
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
Not yet... Section 4236...
Make ourselves a target?
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
Not as yet, sir.
A lie?
I don't want to.
I believe you. Please...
What?
No, sir.
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
I know precisely where he'll be.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
Yes, sir.
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
You are me.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
How long is that?
It'll serve you right.
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  Theres no crying in Starfleet.
Not tonight, I have work here.
Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
It'll only work for one of us.
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Emergency force fields are holding.
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Understood.
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
Aye, sir
Still well on our side...
Anything.
And the Senate supports you?
I have dissolved the Senate.
You know I need to verify this.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
How did you end up on Remus?
In time.
You're not Reman.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
Why are you here?
Not so long.
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
You don't have to understand.

For the moment.
How much are your rooms?
I'll take that.
I understand.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
They must have picked it up in space.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
Marc Shermin.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Gear shift.
X...
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
I...
You didn't even see it.
How will I do this one?...
Yes.
No... The closest...
Yes?
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
What is hell?
He will.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I don't want you to be hurt.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
What for?
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
We can.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Slow down, slow down.
In the cars, too?!
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
I did.
It could have been anything.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
You know that's impossible!
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
Bullshit politics.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
Jesus.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
Only way I could stand your ties.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
Sorry.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
I always do.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Yeah, but that was for love.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
Jesus, Lenny.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Wants to share.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
No, it's not.
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
She's buried.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Excuse me?
What are you doing?
Go ahead.
I don't believe this.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
How long ago?
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
None taken.
How long have you been downtown?
What's that?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Jaime? Where are you?
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
You were right. He found me.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
How are we going to find him?
No weapon.
How's the arm?
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.
Something came up, Murman, my man.
Lead the way, Murman.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Yes, sir.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
No. Stop, come on.
Oh... a Cavalier.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
You too?
Like what?
Anything.
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
You haven't told then, huh?
No.
I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
You want this in black chips.
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
It's a rebound.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
I would love to see you again sometime.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Hi, Mike?
Are you on the other line?
Yeah, hold on.
That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
Good.  I think about things.
What kind of things?
Why didn't you call?
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Unless she comes back first.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I got to at least try once.
No. Just O.J.
Well, that's dumb.
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
I didn't make it...
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
What are they doing here?
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
Wow, I guess you were home... 
That's right.
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
Tonight, baby.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Vegas.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
She didn't like me, anyway.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
It's on.
What a surprise.
We're not messing with you...
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
...Is he brown?
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
See, baby?
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...Yeah.
...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything...
...Shut up, Sue...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Good.  He never doubted you.
Yes. 
You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
I'm going to finish school.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
You wanted me to be your son.
Then why have I become a man like you?
Good.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
No.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
That's for you to find out.
Get rid of them...
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Can you do it Mike?
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
Who is he?
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
OK. 
Can I go to the hospital with you?
When will I see you again?
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
You just woke up!
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Shut up!
Did you speak to my father?
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
How?
You love me and you're not marrying me.
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
I hope she never knows.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
He's not a man, he's a god.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
I think you're right.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
I think we sort of found each other.
Right.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
You know what -- I am.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Thanks.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
Or I could come back.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
Peter, I... I...
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
My God!
Hello, Betsy.
Sure.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
What is it? I'm busy.
That's fine.
What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic.  So howsit?
Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
Nah.  I suppose not.
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
A girl needs protection.
No.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Can I see you again?
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
What do you mean?
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Education?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Why do you ask?
Why?
Oh?
I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
O.K., cowboy.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
And  I love you, Pete!
Dad... 
I do?
Through the door.  It comes apart.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
I'm sorry.
Oh.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Well, then, as what did you go?
I do.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
No.  But...
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
And... what's my name again?
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
You bet.
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
I'll save you the trouble.  I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
We live in a theater?
No, I'm not much of a dancer.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Thirty a month.
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
You can't testify.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
You mean, he was... let go, too?
I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
No, not really.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
How'd you happen to come here?
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
I see.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
That's up to you.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
No!
I don't think your mother would like that.
Just a little one.
Don't you like us?
Darling, of course I do!
I think they'll be all right, honey.
Try my best.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Yes?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Yep?
The little girl's name.
Thank you.
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
They're back!
Yes.
How long have you known her?
Yes.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Yes, Mother.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
I don't know.
You're doing fine.
No.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
We know what it is, Al.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
Yes.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
How can you tell?
Hey, wait a minute!
How?
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
What for?
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
He was watching a ball game on television.
What?
Oh, yes.
San Francisco's a long way from here.
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
Yes.
I told you what happened in Rome!
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
Cheers.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
I do different things on different days.
Yes.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
No, tell me.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
I'll get it.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
...everything I know.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Have we still got power?
Oh. Oh, well, all right.
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
It is a pity.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
But Richardson?
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
Pulse?
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
What do you mean, Fettes?
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
I am the best man for the job.
No.
I've had some experience.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
Get out of here!
Only Brother.
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
How long ago?
Three years.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
No great lady will ever take my place?
I'm looking for my friends.
Dream on.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Where the fuck did you come from?
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
No...
No. You don't.
Yes I do, I really do.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
Shut up.
Good for you. You do know something.
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
I mean Lauren.
Not tonight. Honest.
What did I say?
Just hold on to me.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
It still doesn't mean...
Looks like you have them both on.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
Yes -- that is true.
Would you care to be more specific?
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
No -- not at all.
That can easily be arranged.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
You must have come a long way.
The present situation?
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
Well, we could--
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
How do you know?
Is that what you're thinking about?
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
This one could save your life.
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
We don't ride with vampires.
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
That's right.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
Okay, okay.
Lots more where he came from.
Did we have a date tonight?
I better get cleaned up, then.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Gotta go, Mom.
Soon.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
He's already gone to bed.
But, Mom...
Lucy.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
When?
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
Huh?
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
Entertain yourself.
Don't bother.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
Just listen.
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
You can't let anybody leave!
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
What for?
Then I'll have to kill you.
All in Norwegian.
Thank you.
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
And that was enough?
Hope so.  Another ten, fifteen minutes.  What I don't get is...
Then we go after him.
Hear what?
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
Where?
No...
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Morlocks --
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
What do you mean?
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
Vox...
As slaves.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
I'm a foolish man.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Got here as soon as I could.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Dance with me...
Holding you... again.
All right...
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
Do you know you were humming?
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
She's gotten into your equations.
Perseverance.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
I live with it every minute of every day.
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
I can't do that --
His home.
You're not from beyond the valley.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
You know this?
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
Someone you loved very much.
Mara...?
Here?
We choose to believe it.
They're inside --
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
Then how would you describe him, Beth? Merely rebellious?
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
No, we were patients.
They should just be looking harder.
Good.
No, it hasn't.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
After I...
What?
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
I know.
Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
No. I don't want it to.
So it's helping?
Maybe.
You still don't believe me, do you?
What are you talking about?
I wasn't talking about anything.
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
Sure.
Thanks.
[Beat] Real is overrated.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
I gotta go to Little Rock.
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Yes, sir.  I know.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
That sounds nice.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
What?
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
Why are you actin' like this?
You're not touchin' that car.
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
I think better when I drive.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
I won't wait up.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
No.
Yeah.
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Before.
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
What?
I believe you.
Yes.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Yeah, you want it?
Are you alright?
Whatever.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
How long do you think that'll take?
All this for us?
Go.
You, too, sweetie, the best.
You got that right.
Fresno.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
I guess.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Good-looking?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
His mother?
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Huh? But why did Healy?
Yeah feels like it.
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Hm?
You know, clean the pipes.
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
Jesus Christ you're right.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Call you back.
Thanks.
Big time.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
No I can't.
Am I?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Pat Healy.
It's right there on your golf bag.
Some buildings I'm working on.
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Well, I'll see ya.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Nah, really, it was moronic.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
She's in a wheelchair?!
Uh, that's okay.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
What do you mean 'why'?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're too hard on guys.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
Good lookin'?
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
I appreciate you looking out for me.
You look great.
Thanks.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
Mary, come on...
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Eh.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Huh...?
Yes, sir.
Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
I think it's a bad idea.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Yes it is.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
Forget it, Scotty.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Just a second, Mr. President.
Oh, yeah -- right.
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
Tell him, Ray.
Good. Thank you.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Thanks, Cooch.
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
You've got no jurisdiction.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
Let's go.
Why should I tell you.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Come back?
Never mind.
Do you want a coffee?
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
How the hell do you know?
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
Well, it is. It is that, too.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
For what?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
How about what?
How about anything, anything you want to do.
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
In that order?
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.
Now?
That's up to you.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Remember one thing.
He's pissing me off!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Just relax.
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
What do you want?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Tom Kazansky.
No shit. The Iceman....
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Gotta keep track of the competition.
What?
I've had enough...for now.
I want him!
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
Let's go. Eject.
What'd you do?
That's because you don't have any women.
What now?
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
Who is the best.
I think I can work it out on my own.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
Me?
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Then why are you here?
Oh, you mean the thrill!
The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.
She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?
Or you can quit.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
How'd you find me?
Would you like the same suite?
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Who is it this time--my mother?
Do you expect me to believe you?
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
That's right.
Arrest that woman!
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
On his way.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
Yeah.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Bye.
I'm not your wife.
I'm honored.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
I guess he didn't.
You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
There's something I have to tell you...
Not any more.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
I used to model for 'em, why?
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
No problem.
You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
Could we make it to the mountains?
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
You got that right.
The rifle.
Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
Me, too.
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
What?
Yeah, Val.
Let's assume that it is.
It does.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
I'm dead. We're both dead.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
In other words, seven times out of a hundred, you're wrong!
I have to talk to your brother.
The hell you do. At this hour?
Sustained.
I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
I specialize, Roger...
Eddie... I don't know about this...
-- You found his mugshot?
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
Roger Baron.
You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
You're doing a murder case?
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
I embroidered.
I don't need sleep!
Afraid of what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
No. You tell me, Shu.
It was self-defense.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
No, s-sir.
Let's not drag the Constitution into this.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case.
Argumentative.
Badgering.
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
-- alleged crime --
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer.
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me?
And its purpose?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
That's right.
And why was an exception made?
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Get lost Bobby.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Thank you, Carl.
Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Can you tell me what their names were?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
Okay, Gordon!!!
Smell something fishy, huh?
Sorry to hear it.
What happened to her?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
It must be a high priority situation.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
She must have known someone.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Donna, are you my best friend?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
No, you should forget about last night.
You're not mad at me?
I can't help you there.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
Brother, I hear you talkin'.
Who would do that?
Bob.
What does Bob say?
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
When am I going to see you?
What about tonight?
What?
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
I'm sorry, Mom.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
It's a school night... back by nine.
...school's fine...
We're late to get to your mother.
Yes.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Very good.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
It's a crime.
You would not...?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Just as you are, Sir...
No.
I'm just an M.D.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Your Honor...! Your Honor...
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Well, we...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I... um...
And you wrote that...
Yes.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
You're going to settle out of court?
The most respected...
I used to be a nurse.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I'm sure you would.
Ready, your Honor.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Mr. Concannon...?
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
I have to talk to you.
Pardon?
Missus...
No.
And ask me what?
Then why don't you testify?
...fifty thousand dollars?
...I understand...
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
He's not in, Sir.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
...hey, I don't need your charity...
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
They still have to take it to a jury.
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
The Doctors.
I don't know.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She told me.
I just saw her.
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
How'm I doing so far?
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
I'll request the scientists from Pacific-Tech to monitor the drop.  We'll clear the area all around.  After that we'll hit them all over the world. I'll have long-range bombers alerted, loaded and standing by.
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
Have you got a pocket compass?
We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
Couldn't you try to communicate with them first - and shoot later if you have to?
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
I'm sure we can match any offer.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Hasn't been another call, has there?
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Chase, it's Dylan!
Is he all right?
Home, that's right.
I know he is, sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
A story?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
Fred Krueger did it.
Yes?
I'm afraid there was an accident.  It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Choice?  What kind of choice?
No, not really.  I...
Now?
Your father?
He knows.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
Me either.
Like this!
I guess.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
Passport?
Look, I just better go.
Fine.
Ya know... "It".
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Who?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
Of what?
I don't know.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Yes sir.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
What's that?
That's enough.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
You've gotta be kidding?
Son of a bitch!!
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
Aaauuuhhh!!!
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
Y'all take American Express?
Yessir.
Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
Get out.
You was in the Marines, huh?
You an indian?
Ready for another?
Have now.
Yeah... yeah... I guess so... That kind'a money'd get us a long way down that yellow brick road...
Why should it?
That's right... Take one of these.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Used to.
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
Thanks.
Muchas gracias.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
What happened on the charges?
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
You won't of missed much.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
That don't seem fair.
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
Come look at this.
What's that, honey?
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
You got me, peanut.
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
Uh huh.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
You upset with me?
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
It's a comfortin' idea.
SAILOR!!!
A little, I think... Darlin'?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
So where'd you say you was?
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
Shake hands with your daddy.
Lead the way.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Like hell.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Got any plans?
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Shoot him.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
On one condition...
Santos... I can't...
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
He heard everything we were saying.
Hit your brakes.
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
That was MacCaulay.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
Bullshit.
How long have you been having them?
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Better luck next time.
No. There's no one here.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Sure.
Like the lady herself.
I've got tenure.
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
What's he saying?
I put you on the floor.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
What'd you tell him?
That's a big book you're writing.
But... ?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that.
Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
Because of my coat?
What would you call them then?
When?
When nobody's looking.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
All right.
Really, Sara, I...
Inside.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
He told me.
Oh?
Why yes. How did you know?
Sure it is.
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
Grady?
This is important.
Oh... yeah.
I don't know. It might be...
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
When can I see her?
C'mon, Walter.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
Isn't it?
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
I have no idea.
Like a piece of shit? In my eyes, you are a piece of shit. Think anyone would miss you if I threw you out the window right now? I could say you jumped when I came in. Who are they going to believe? Not you, because you'd be a dead piece of shit.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
The girl.
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I went to bed around seven.
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.
It's all the same.
Ev-i-dence.
You think reflection is good.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Why do you think you're here?
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
I want to be normal!
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
To relax.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
It was a small house.
What do you think?
Doesn't it get noisy?
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
No you're not.
Do you?
Since you've had sex?
Because I like you.
Yeah.
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Why not tell me now?
You must hate your brothers.
Neither am I.
Move in with me.
That's not what I meant.
Prove it.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
That must be it.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
What happened?
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
But what did he see that made him panic?
What do you think he saw?
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
They'll come out after us.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
Tell me later.
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
All right.  Do it!
You watch yourself.
Turn it up, bozo.
Give me that!!
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Wilhite, anything?
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
Then why don't you try it on?
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Yes, very much so.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
It takes even less.
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
Okay. In a few minutes.
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
Late, very late.
I don't love you.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Yes, yes, of course.
And where do you find the models?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
And what did they say about me?
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
Unfortunately, no.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
I know, dammit, I know!  And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
You're kidding!
Yes.
No.
Because...
But she watches... she listens.
I'm not hungry.
Of God.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
Why?
Yes, Mother.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
I don't know.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Uh huh.
I love you.
At least once a week.
Would you like to talk about it?
Why should they?
How were you sick?
What baby?
Agnes, how are babies born?
Don't you know?
Would you like to ask them?
What else did she tell you?
Like what?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
How did she know that?
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you?
No, but I can never tell her that.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
A mistake...
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
Not my fault.
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
And you're unhappy.
Yes.
She watches... she listens.
Yes?
Why?
What?
Agnes, you're stupid.
Why?
May I open my eyes now?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
No.
I ate.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
What did she mean?
And the passage to the barn?
Where?
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
No...
Look into the convent records.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
Uh huh.
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
Could there have been anyone else?
That's ridiculous...
She stopped eating completely...
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
There's another choice.
Oh, some time in January.
Don't deny it!
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
No, it reminds me.
Would you like one?  Huh?
Even Christ would partake socially.
Mary Magdelen?
For the Church?
She is an innocent.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Hasn't she had enough?
Was it you?
Yes.
You tied the cord around its neck.
Before or after you killed the child?
Eight and two thirds.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Yeah?
What they like?
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
Yeah.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
Of course I can.
I'll have a bash.
Ta.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
Have I said something amiss?
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
Wake up!
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
The big hammer?
They ought to be.
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Books are good!
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
I'm going parading before it's too late!
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
Oh, they seem all right to me.
Lip reading.
What's he on about?
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
Yeah ... so what?
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
Oh, I see.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Don't be callous.
Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
What's old got to do with it?
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Oh you are, I know you are.
And my nose...
What have you heard?
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Don't exaggerate.
Someone put it on me.
And they want me?
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Is that you, Roby?
I'm not kidding.  You can get one if you have the credit.  Look just like real cows, too.
Or something will be able to see us.
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
Martin, we're going in.  I'm going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on.
But functioning.
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
What is it, I can't --
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
God I'm hungry.
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
A transmission?
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
Yeah!
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
Maybe we can catch it.
How do we locate the creature?
Got a better idea?
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I've completely lost their signal.
Three blips!  They're coming this way!
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
I think it's fizzled out.
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
What's the frequency?
My signal's fading.
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Turn on navigation lights.
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
It appears to be some sort of spacecraft.  We're going to approach it.
But?
Still worried?
But why draw it on the wall?
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
We're coming!
Go ahead, Jay.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.
Can we get to him?
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Sure.
Wait a minute.
Thanks.
We're not gonna make it, are we?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
What?
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
Just behind us, over to the right.
Yeah, I...
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Done it already.  Nothing matches.
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Four.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
It wasn't meant to be.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
I'm in love with Lloyd!
... and Karen.
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
You can have one at Max's.
I don't think I'm going.
You were there? At the play - last night?
She may be later than you think...
Eve! My understudy...
Of course I knew.
How nice.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
Huh?
This is Eve Harrington.
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
And cut that out right now.
When - when are you coming back?
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Yeah... I will.
Okay.
Cut it out.
For instance what?
- guilty.
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
What a body, what a voice.
Now don't get carried away-
Paranoiac!
Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I'll say.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
You were great.
Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
I just wondered.
The names I've been called. But never Svengali.  Good luck.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
Find out.
I never played Fort Sumter.
Oh, brother.
Do you want an argument or an answer?
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
Subway.
I don't care if I never get home.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
My husband...
I'd like that.
Karen.
I think she would cheer.
They'll do as they're told.
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
I don't intend to be.
There can't be very much-
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
I'll never get over it.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Over my dead body...
Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery.  When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards?  That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...  ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...
Of course it is.
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Ain't it the truth?
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
That's on time for Margo.
What is?
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
I'm trying hard to follow you.
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
I'm beginning to catch up.
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise-
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
That was way back...
What is he talking about?
Up in the room.
When you do, let me in on it.
Twentyish. It isn't important.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
I never said it was!
I don't think I could be.
It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights!  I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
About the past year.
And you haven't called him?--
The fucking New York Times.
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--we gotta top the Times--
--I know, I know--
--shit, who do we know?--
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
Hmm?
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
Chapin did contact you then?
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
I don't know what they'd do to me.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
What do you want to know?
Something maybe big.
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
--my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
To where?
Go on.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. And he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. A woman who was watching asked, "What's the trick?" And he replied. "The trick is not minding."
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
It may never come out.
Nobody ever had too much.
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
I can't sell hints to Simons--  --you called everyone you know?  Call someone you don't know.
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
--maybe I'm tense--
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
Haldeman.  Right?
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
No, none of those.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
...okay...
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
Yes ma'am, I am.
No idea.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Do I have to?
You don't like it?
I wasn't making fun of you.
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
You talked to Stifler?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
I'm not playing.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
No you haven't.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Do you love her?
Uh...
It's all good.  Breath check.
Holy shit!
Okay!
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Well...uh...
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Move with the music.
Nadia, I can't --
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Tonight?
Okay, don't stop.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
That's my trick!
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
I love you.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Qualify for what?
What's that?
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
I don't care.
Fuck yeah we will.
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
Exactly.
Just like sex with my wife.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Andy!
I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
Why the fuck would I do that?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Allo?
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
I was showing Sonya something . . .
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
Now just get off the train.
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
I'm sorry.
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
Don't be
I'm glad you	did too.
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
I cursed then all!
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
Bartok... a question.
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
M'mm.
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
Why not?
Yeah? Allison what?
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
How can you possibly oversleep?
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Oh, no, I have a car.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Sure, I got... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Yeah. Oh, God bless!
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
what I mean?
Really, do you think so, really?
Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.
Gimme a kiss.
Really?
As Balzac said...
Oh, yeah?
No.  You're a wreck.
Good? I was-
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
M'hm.
Yeah.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
It relaxes me.
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
M'm.
M'hm.
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Will it change your wife?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Life. I said, "life."
David! David! I can't believe this!
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
I don't know.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Yeah.
I'm cool.
Remember that day?
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
Oh, Alvy, come on.
The usual, you know. Uh, tryin' t' write. I'm workin' on a play.  Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?
The what?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Commentary.
Oh, you got a headache!
I can think of another word.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
What are you depressed about?
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Yeah, I love it there.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Look, uh...
There are no twos, Max.
We're gonna operate together.
She was going through my pocketbook!
She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
...of possibly working together.
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
Oh, gosh.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
There were many men interested in you?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
And you've only just met.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
No, what?
The movie.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
October-ish.
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
He's allergic.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
And you're not the wife.
Oh, very jealous.
Well it's fucking time.
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
Not as a rule.
They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
Anytime, sport.
Probably not.
So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
We're great.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
I'm going to throw up.
Really?
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Truce.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Love?
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
Hello?  Last birthday was?
I don't look my age, Joe.
Don't.
Me too.
That's under lock and key.
I know.
Oh, Sally Mae...
I'll do it.
Yes I did.
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
I meant Sally.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
Let's go for a walk.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
Lemon it is.
You must have been a baby.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
Why?
Really??
Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you see.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
Fuck you, Panes.
You see, that's worse.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
Like the last time.
What does that mean?
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Well, something's wrong.
Yes, you're a monster.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
What are they?
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
So where should I put it?
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
Stop fooling around in there.
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Well...no, but --
Oh no...
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
I'm glad you asked me that question!
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
Well, I have some paper towels --
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
No.
You mean tonight?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
I forgive you.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
This is a bad day for me.
You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
Sure I do. It's always nice to have company for Christmas.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Someone from the office.
Give what up?
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I don't want it.
Too slow?
Was he really upset when you told him?
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
Sure.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
For me?
Are you supposed to?
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
Might as well go all the way.
Cheers.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
That's very wise.
Gas?
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
You do?
How do you work it with the key?
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
You know how people talk.
Well -- I guess so.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Yes, sir -- I understand.  She left a note -- you want me to open it and read it to you?  Well, it was just a suggestion -- no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise --
I see.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Thank you, sir.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Yes?
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
You?
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
No!
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Something like that.
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying?  Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember?
What's her address?  Where does she live?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Still stuck on her, huh.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
I missed you, Fran.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
Okay. I'm sorry.
Fran --
Now, Fran --
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
I told you -- with my mother.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Go where?
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
See if they'll what?
Oh -- oh!
Where are you headed?
Sit down -- we'll talk about it.
You can keep your fucking fuel --
Get out --
Which part is that ?
Yeah. Way north.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Tracks ?
We do.
A long time.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
Yes, sir --
You got to kill this sonuvabitch -- Lance and me, we don''t understand none of this -- Jesus, Captain -- I don't wanna die here -- Do it quick.
Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
Listen.
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Looks pretty shallow.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
What is it?
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
A lame ?
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
But why ?
Well, he's killing now.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
What?
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
What do you mean?
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
Six to eight feet.
Wh -- what?
No. Walked.
What do you mean, Colonel?
Yeah, I like it...
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
You knew him best.
Were you with him, when...
What?
Yeah... thanks.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
Nah.
Which one's the Colonel's?
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
You're Australian?
Cognac?
No. Not really.
Yes.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
139  CONTINUED:
157  CONTINUED:
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
Had?
How did she..?
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
The radio's on the fritz.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Come here...
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
Too bad we're heading west.
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
You don't know how true that is.
You broke the radio, remember?
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
I could've sat tight for the transport, 'til Bob came poking around.
You met the gift.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
I want us to go out.
Uh-huh.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
Carol the waitress?
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
You take off when you have to.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Are you still coming?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Dancing?
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
That seems like a good choice.
What do you want?
Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
I'll take care of myself --
You think you're kidding.
No. No. Get Carol.
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
I'm not saying nothing to you.
He's a pain in the ass.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
What?
They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
Wait here.
Well, I can't reach them.
Oh, is he dead?
Well, that's a load off.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Come on, sweetheart...
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
Another place where?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Absolutely not.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Right.
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
Probably.
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
Sounds like chickenshit --
Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks have they got here?  Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.
What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
Why don't you tell me.
Bain!
You're too late.
Take us there.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
I know.  It was a joke.
I bet you fucking know!
It cost us.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
Yes.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Why?
How did you get into the business?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
I was just different.
Women?  No... not really.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Why did you leave the Agency?
Then you went freelance?
Yes.
Because I want to know.
That's fiction.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
Mexico.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Yes.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
For Nicholai?
Yes.
I went into their room this afternoon.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
That's a ridiculous move.
I'm sure you will.
Yes.
She was taken.
Did you --
Is this becoming complicated?
Uh-huh.
Yes.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
Yes.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
A dime.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Why didn't you fade?
You mean quit?
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Well, don't get carried away.
Tough break.
I don't know. This wall isn't like the rest though, it's not all that old either.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Is it gone four-thirty?
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
No, not yet.
Honza says they'll print an open letter to President Havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk-out.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Yeah, somewhere?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
I should have read the fine print.  I love you Holly, thanks.
I'm not hungry, really.
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
So am I.
No!
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
I think he's jealous of Havel.
You used to read.
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
You're everything a guy could want.
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
So, we won't be going to London?
No, it's not true, you're lying.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
Will this thing take long?
Am I invited?
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
Alright!
Cool....Either of you know the way to Krakow?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
Yeah!
Working....Under cover.
Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka.
Come on, that shit can wait.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
And what of these foreigners?
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
Me neither.
Late night.  You?
Landon --
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
I'm just wondering --
Later.
My act?!
Because that's where the fire is?
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Good thing.
Ambitious.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Yeah.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
Prove it.
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
It's only 7:30.
We're doing something -- ?
What do you actually know with religion?
You planned this --
Where? Why?
I don't want to come here anymore.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
No.
It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Then you remember more than I do.
Where did you get -- ?
Yeah.
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Not now....
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
Why what?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
March 11th.
Nineteen fifty --
Home, school, here... 
Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
Oh, yeah.
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
We don't....
That's just great!
I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Curious... Very curious....
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
I run this place! 
No way!
You don't mind?
You lost that one?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Holly.
What?
There you go.
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
I don't know.
Bring it along.
Is that all there is to it?
What?
Just looking.
Excuse me.
It was going too fast.
Really?
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
Wanta sue me?
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
They're stealing my chopper!
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
The door's locked.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Which?  The one in my throat.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
John Whorfin will kill us!
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
...I know this must look... funny.
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
Barton!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
I need help, Audrey.
...Huh? No, I'm 
I'm a writer. Ted O 
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
Well, I'm just asking. You sound a little 
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Well, we've got something in common then.
Well, I can tell you some stories 
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Well...
Charlie, I'm in trouble  something horrible's happened  I've gotta call the police...
I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
Transient or resident?
The others are being sent.
Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
You don't look so okay.
Catherine Tramell.
Who?
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
Tell me about Catherine.
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
Thanks.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
No.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Yeah.  Would you like to come up and have a drink?
Ice?
Please.
Yes.
To see if I can get away with it.
I'll meet you there.
She's seen everything before.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
No.
Everybody that I care about dies.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
No thanks.
I'm writing a book.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
Why not?
We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
He was murdered.
Why would I need an attorney?
Yes I am.
How's that?
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Routine.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nilsen?
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
Thanks.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
I know what that's like.
I went over last night, too.
Why the hell not?
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
What was it?
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
Fuck you, too Nick.
No.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
Are you vice?
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
Can you check again?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
What about the shit they write?
Saddle River, New York!
Ignorant art?
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
How much for these five?
You haven't been by lately.
You want a drink?
Sure, ok..
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
I hate this. Turn that off.
They're just words.
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
What are they?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Yeah.
Willie Mays.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
Drugs??!
Can I walk you home?
You're back.
Think so?
You're your own baby.
Don't you think he's using you?
Me? Why?
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
"Shreck's."  You --
Didn't I say that?
Yes and no ...
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
"We"?  You and...
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
Well it's not working.
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
Eventually she married a young physician.
What is it?
It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son.  Take it, child.  But I implore you, never open it.  You look so like your mother.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Yes?
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
I don't know.  It just feels right.
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
What?
I wish I knew.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
Why, indeed?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
There's one other thing. I feel..
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
How ya doin', Al?
What's wrong?
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
You understand obsession better than you let on.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
But...
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
What?
You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
Absolutely not.
Bruce, you can't.
Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
... We could try that.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
You okay?
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
Tom Jones?
Did you really ask?
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
Night.
What?  What?
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Isn't it?
You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. .  Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Quite right, sir.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Sean Connery.
Sure.  You're right.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Why thank you sir.
I am sorry you feel that way.
What's gone?
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
Yeah, we should party.
Uh... Uh...
Forget it, bunghole!
Huh huh huh.
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Heh heh. Thank God.
Cut it out butt-hole!
Cool, huh huh.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
What's your problem Beavis?
Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
Dill-wad...
Um... ass... head...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Ah, the witness?
I see it. I don't get it.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
She sure does.
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
Yup. Huh huh.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Adam!
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
Two hours.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
What's she doing here?
They make gypsies look good.
Not really...  what's this?
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Of course I did.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Help vouchers?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
What do you expect?  You're dead.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
No, wait!
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Yeah.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Good girrrl!
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.

I'm beeyoo-teeful.
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Otho'll know what to do.
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
An attorney?
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
No.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I have no idea...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
No. I like this attic very much.
Yes. I am.
No. It won't do that.
... Mentor...?
Oh, I like that very much.
How is Ben feeling?
I see.
... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
I like to watch.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
Ben is very ill.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Yes. I like that name very much.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Thank you, Ben.
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
I agree.
Of course. I would like to look.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
Yes. That is surprising.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Since you were a child?
No.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.
... Hello.
Yes. I will.
... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
Try again.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
I said good night!
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Clearly, yes comrade.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
I would appreciate that.
Good. Anything else?
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Yeah.
Who am I thinking of?
Which one is Elijah again?
The monkey.
I... puppeteer.
Seven-ish
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Just an idea I had.
The iguana.
Now?
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Don't crowd me, Craig.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
Fuck Maxine.
You bastard.
A better friend.
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Simulates?
That... was... no... simulation.
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Yessir.
Thank you, sir.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Maxine.
My tits?
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
The Great Mantini?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Thank you, Floris.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
What's the play?
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Lotte called me.
No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
What want ye, girl child?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
Baby, don't be like that.
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
Thank you.
What you want'em for?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Well, what can you do?
But mama..
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
You planning to do anything about it?
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
I don't believe that. I won't.
It ain't what you think.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
Yeah, but we're--
What--
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
It's already posted.
Well--
No, they--
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Your rug was in the car.
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Thank you.
She most certainly was not!
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Well yeah...I know that.
So Dieter has the money?
This was a valued, uh.
What the fuck are you--
Am I wrong!
Hey man--
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
Calmer than you are.
What if it's during a game?
That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him.
Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's the bridge--
What the fuck?
Walter, please--
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
But Walter--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Thanks Walter.
Now Dude--
Nihilists!  Jesus.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Uh-huh.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Uh-huh.
Who is this?
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
Friends like these, huh Gary.
Did I urinate on your rug?
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
I'll heal.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Minutes.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Like cancer with a purpose.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
Where the hell have you been?
So?
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
From his father, of course.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
No, we can treat the wounds --
I don't buy it.
There are other ways to see. Sit.
Who is LaMagra?
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
There is no cure.
How can you tell?
There are worse things than vampires out there.
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
I'm not leaving without you.
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
For them. But for me --
Fight him --
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
You.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
Get away from him!
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
Habit, mostly, just like this.
Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
How?
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
Closer.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
It's like traveling back in time.
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
--you should get back into bed.
--no, what's wrong with you?
You have to go.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
Fine.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
What're you, nuts?
Still don't see it--
My room, asleep, last I checked.
--I saw what I saw.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
<u>What</u>--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
--turn the camera off--
--a Wiccan--
This isn't about us.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
--no.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
She's far from "fine."
What happened to my Dad??
Yes.
It won't?
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
Meurice--
Yeah.
See a guy.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
I couldn't believe it either...
When you don't they're usually nice.
Ray--
I don't know what you're talking about.
...What was that?
Marty.
All right...
I own the place.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
See, I never knew that.
Fine. Suit yourself.  ...Having a good time?
Yeah? Well how irritated are you?
I don't know, didn't he call?
Pour that back.
This.
Meurice...
For what?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Is Sandy part of this?
Hello, daddy.
Then, shut up!
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Oh yeah, that's good.
What do you want?
Yes.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
. same here.
Sure I do.
Whatiya mean?
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Come on Dorothy.
Sometimes I think I do.
Just get outta my bed.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I'm glad you do.
What?
No.  Hi baby.
It's okay. it's okay.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
Where are they?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
O.K.
Okay. yeah, call.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
Yeah?
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
See ya tomorrow.
I'm really sorry.
Oh yeah?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Dorothy Vallens?
Probably not. no. Why?
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Are you feeling okay?
Be right down.
Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Um-hmm.
Derek!
You'll see for yourself.
Derek!
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
Yes, I am.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
Yeah.  She told me.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
We're half a million off.
Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now?
In how long?  A week?
Today.
I want money.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
You're not going to trial?
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
That's where you belong...
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Tuna.
Put that shit away, they're here.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
I'll be here.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
But I've got school.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
So, we need to get to the source.
That's right.
No. It has failed in its objective.
Exactly.
And here?
I'll explain.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Here?
Good evening, sir.
How can I give you this statement?
I want you to hit all the dealers in town.  Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use.  Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in Roseburg.
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
What about the will?
The official cause?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Yes.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
No -- never.
No.  Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted.  So, either you charge her now or we're leaving.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Thank you.
Yes.
Tell the court about that, please.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
She was here?
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
It didn't.
She left me.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
Can you give the court an example?
No.
No.
No further questions.
That's enough.
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Why does she come to you?
High school?
No.
Did he make your life miserable?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
Yes.
Dristan nasal spray.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
Then you would have gotten your money?
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
You know I can't talk about that.
Yes.
No further questions.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
You still haven't answered my question.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
That's not an answer.
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
It's okay.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
What would?
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
Yeah.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
No, Your Honor.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
I can back it up.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
I'm not.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
That's too bad.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, I can help.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
Was this during Betty?
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Oh, yes.
Not this kind of heat.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
You want me to call the doctor?
That must be it. It's a great smell.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
About a year and a half.
No, your kids.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
I doubt that.
What's he like?
Is the dizziness gone?
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
Yes.
What?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
I told you, I love other people.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
What made you ask such a question?
... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
I'll pick you up.
I want you to come.
How about Italy?
Have you ever been to that station?
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Trouble. Why?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
What?
Uh-huh. And?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
How do you know what I experience?
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
What about us? What about me?
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Sure.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Hmm?
Betty.
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Hell no!
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Just some flies.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --
That's some terrible shit.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
What it will be.
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
And the hell everybody else, right?
Then fuck it!!!
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
Mother!  No.
That place is already bad luck.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
You got the shit?
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Dad?
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
That building?
Evidence of what?
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
What's that, Johnnie?
All right!  Where's the key?
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
No!
Give it to me.
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
Jesus, Caesar!
You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
They just left, didn't they?
No!  They're still on their way.
That doesn't make any sense.
No.
Violet, I won't let you leave.
I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
Go right ahead, sir.
Where's the fucking money?
Lick me.
Are you okay, Violet?
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
Caesar, you still got the money?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Yeah, that's it.
Where in the hell is he?
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
My pleasure.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
What do you want?
No.
No.
He's a launderer?
Five years is a long time.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
Work.
You think I'm lying?
Is that what you think?
Do you think you know me like that?
I think ...
Does the case lock?
Why?
Sweet Jesus.
If he does ...
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
How'd it go?
Pop?
Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk now.  You too, Johnnie.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
I thought you were never going to do that.
And what if I couldn't do that?
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
What do they want me to do?
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Keep it. 
Get the kids out!
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Thanks.
Yes.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
It's a little late for that.
I've got a situation here and --
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
I know that.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
Where are we?
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
I didn't know this would happen.
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
-- we'll explain it --
Nykwana Wombosi. 
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
Yes.
Shit, we didn't sign in.
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
Hang on... 
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
Abbott wants to talk.
-- he accessed the account --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
I told you.  You need to rest.
I don't remember Zurich.
Thank you.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
... fix themselves.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
... new washer.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Oh, right ...
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
Too late? That's for me to say.
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
Long time no see!
Er, I knew you looked different.
What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Do you know what you're doing.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Jack ...
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
If you say so.
Oh.
Them?
I don't know.  Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.
It's my fucking life.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Why?
It does doesn't it?
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Who will?
Get away!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
What happened to you after ...
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Oh my God, a mistake!
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
Hang on.
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
I never signed the form.
I want to talk to him.
But ... I called Central Services.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
The pace?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
Time to go.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
You can trust me on this one.
Mary ...
He looks like a cop.
He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
Got a beer?
I should be going. I just quit.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
Oh man, Bucky.
The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster.
He's dead, huh?
No.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
I'll be right down.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
He's better.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
I need to sit down a minute.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
Greatest job in the world.
I quit! I'm through!
What do you think?
No.
Crazy fucker.
Yes.
The brakes are shot.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
That's ridiculous.
Frank!
You're crazy.
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Faster!
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Oh, stop it.
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
Just don't physically...  Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Yes.
Yes.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Eleven and a half.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Of course.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here.
Did you bring your grey suit?
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
How?
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's do this.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
Stop it.
Wipe me out?
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
How long has it been since you've been home.
I'll never tell.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
You talked me into it.
No...no.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
That actually goes on...
How are you at back rubs?
How's it going?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Okay.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Well, what is it?
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
No.  Were you going to you?
Who?
Good.  That's it...See you.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Well, when?
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
What?
How can you say that to me?
It just proves that the difference we have are...
Okay...It's so good to see you.
Go ahead -- what?
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
Are you nervous, Walter?
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
All about me...
Of course I do!
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Forget it.
Just about anything, Walter.
What?
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
I'm honored to know this man.
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
Didn't you hear him?
No man I'm on my own plane.
I said I did, didn't I!
Yeah.
Got carried away, huh?
I-I already got a new one!
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
You want me to open a window or something?
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
Uh, sure.
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Suit yourself.
Here here!
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Coach knows what abs are?
What's with you?
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Wrong answer!  No prize.
What's playing there?
Hi, guys.
Maybe.
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
So I noticed.
I think you've forgotten something.
No...
Buffy.
Hi there.
You want some water or something?
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
You sure?
What for?
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Yeah, whoops I came.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
Am I in trouble or something?
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I have cheerleading squad.
It's true.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Here?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
They were vampires?
Don't start with me again.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
I...
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
They don't even have Dolby.
I guess.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Sorry.
My parents have money...
Hi, Grueller.
Got that.
Jeffrey!
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
You want some punch?
Well, look who's here.
I am.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
I think you're real cute.
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
I don't dance.
Yep.
That's my job too.
You got me all confused.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
He' s confused--
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
Oh let's not...
Oh both of you, of course...
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Never heard of 'em.
I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit.
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
You're a cocksucker!
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
Gimme that.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Then go.
You're a great catcher.
Fear and ignorance.
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it.  Beats hell outta working at Sears.
Love to--
Pussy.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
Who ain't?
You were wandering around.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
A powerful man.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
She's not here, Sam.
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
That's right.
Oh, no, please, please.
If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
Thanks, pal.
Nope, there's no way.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
Listen...
Yeah.
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
It's none of my business?
Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
Don't ask questions. Just be there.
Back -
And what'd she want?
Yeah, uh, who's this?
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
No, that's quite all right.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
What can I do?
Half of everything is mine.
Well, sir, I was just...
Here we go. Good luck.
Oh, no.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Yeah, I know all that.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
Okay.
You can't make me stop caring...
I don't need one.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
Listen...
What do you mean?
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
Mm-hm.
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
Get out of here!
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
That's amazing.
Okay, I'll -
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
Yeah, okay.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
I really think you're -
I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'  I'm firin' you, you -
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
I didn't give 'em the m-
No, you - You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Well, I've been busy. 
You can't talk to me like...
I'll to the FBI!
Fuckers!
He's not here?
Carmine's gone.
E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
Mm.
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
Mm, you want to steal it? 
I know what you mean.
Okay.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
Nothin'.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Exactly.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Yes, you are.
Is that what you want?
A sponsor.
All right. Be careful.
You fucked with me for the last time!
Well, you know...
I told you I was hot tonight.
Ginger, honey.
Get lost?
Yes.
No, Lester.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Listen...
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
Come on, damn it. Don't get so defensive. It could be stuck in your hair, you know.
You know why, right?
Of course.
What's takin' so long over there?
Yeah?
Pleasure.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Charlie M.
How you doin'?
You're a little confused?
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
Oh, sorry -
I know, but that's enough.
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
Having a good time?
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
Guilty. I am.
So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
"Well done," Cactus.
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
Ask me another one--
Ah!  Ah!--God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..
But I'm blind.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Taking messages.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Make a "U" and go back.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Any minute.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
Will you let me explain!
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
No -- nothing.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
What makes you say that?
Oh man.  These people mean business.
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
They don't know you.  They won't listen.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
And that was the end of it?
Sometimes I paint.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
What do you mean?
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Put the man back on.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
L.A.P.D.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
Do you have to point that?
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
A typical fuck-up.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
That's how it's going to be.
Who is this?
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
They saw you kill the driver.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
There are no guarantees in this life.
We don't see you.
Stay there.
Talk to the man.
I don't know what you mean.
Are you trying to panic the women?
Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
Call me "Nels."
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Take the 405 south.
Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Seems not.
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
So who's he?
Now, that was a look.
Hi, Jimmy.
Maybe he wants something.
Stop it, Dil --
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
She's not a tart.
She's not that either.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Not in my experience.
Guy I work with.
What's his name?
Don't know. Who is she?
No, I didn't --
Like what?
Must be.
Yes.
Is this an obsession of yours?
Yeah.
Why?
No...
Yeah. I care, Dil.
That's a start.
Make it up to me, then.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
You following me?
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
You could say that.
I'm sorry.
My pills...
Are you listening?
No.
You didn't.
Okay.
He asked me to see were you all right.
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Aha.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Have a look at him.
He's all right.
No, what is the thing?
What do you mean?
And what happens then?
And what if you don't?
Who's the old geezer?
Thanks.
And do you know why?
He's at home.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
I seen your fucking face.
Can't we take it off?
Well, I could say the same about you.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
And you know the funny thing?
No.
Best game in the world.
Best game in the world.
I'll bear that in mind.
My pleasure, Jody
Hurry up, would you?
These things take time, Fergus.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
We don't look on it like that.
You liked her?
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
I told you not to talk that way --
I'm sorry.
How can I?
Yeah?
No.
You didn't?
You never know.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
Give me the fucking shooter!
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
How do you think I got here?
Can you remember anything at all?
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Oh, I see.
But I don't have it.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Carson?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
Bartholomew?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
No.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Me?
Or you --  Or you --
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Your --
How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
There must be some way.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
There, you said it.
Cutting it out.
Or Tex?
What's so illogical about that?
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
The shower's in there.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Are you going to listen?
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
I'm afraid it is important.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
Meaning what?
The kid said --
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?
I know.  I'm sorry.
Is that all? Can I go now?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Quitter.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Charles is.
Thank you.
I don't know where to go.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
What?
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
Do you tell lies?
How do you know what they're doing?
Va jouer, mon ange.
Because I don't love him.
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
What's he up to?
I never fucked Rod.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
So?
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
It can't be.
No I wasn't.
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
Run!
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
You know where I can find her?
She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
Daddy....
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
He's a rapist. Like mine.
I won't.
You heard about that?
Why?
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
You know I want to go with you.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
You can ask me anything.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
Why not?
And the police did nothing?
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
Who were they?
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
His mother's side.
Just thinking about something.
What?
They're tasty.
No, you keep one.
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.

INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN.
EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/STAIRWELL - DAY.

Well, he told me to collect cash.

Peace.
Come on!

Oh, man.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
Borrowed.
You stole this truck!
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!

Okay. 
You're nuts, goin' back there!
Okay!  All right!

Well, then, that means it's call...

 Okay.
 I'm sorry.  I'm a little 
Come here.

Forty-nine point four.

 Vitelli! Vitelli!
...another way  outta here.    Hey.

Go.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.

Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Who had to put a gun to your head?
...face" crap you've been telling me?
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's right.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
We do need your truck.

...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
Thank you.
...owe you.
...including the permanently extreme.

No, sir.
...to be off the island tonight.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?

No!
It's too...
All right.  After they put you away...
Good to see you again, Leo.
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY.
Get your links set up!

Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--

They'll get a break tomorrow.

I assume you have one.
Odd, then, that his car...

No.
Dead, last time I...

Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
Be sure you feed Bosco.
Oh, no?
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.

Go.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
What's going on, colonel?
Negative.  Negative.
...son.
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
Some people might.
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
 The only one who understands what this me-...
...-m-means, Mason.  
And only then does our noble friend realize...
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
What?
We've got the real thing!
Forty-seven.
Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
...you answer mine.
So you don't remember...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
...to talk, son.
...tunnel now!
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
My daughter.
I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
How did you find out?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
I think I'll kill her.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
Why?
I get by.
Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Oh yes.
No.
Didn't you call?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Absolutely.
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
Yeah.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
A complete surprise?
A private investigator?
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
My husband.
Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
Did he know?
No. I'm just a snoop.
I don't believe you.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Over the water department, or over you?
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Oh, yeah?
Of course I'm sure.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Yeah.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
And I want to know where.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
The Albacore Club.
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
You bastard.
Sure.
Katherine.
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
Oh no.
You'll find one of those people.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I don't understand.
Never.
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?
Then go home and forget about it.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Yeah.
He's not in, Mr.?
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
But that's what you told your wife.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
It tastes wonderful!
That's right, Modern Times.
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
No. And nobody knows where she is.
We'll talk about that later.
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
What does it say there?
That's all there is.
Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
I might make him nervous.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
You know why?  She was so -
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
Yes -
Just old age.  It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.  You ought to see Mr. Leland.  There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
Certainly not.
I don't my plans myself.
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
We've got a nice plant here.
It isn't finished?
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
Charles.
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
You're my wife, Susan, and -
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
What're you going to do, Charlie?
You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
What?
I'm drunk.
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
Are you finished?
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
You won't be lonely, Charles...
Queer?
Well, thanks a lot.
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
I'll have a highball.
Are you serious?
What the hell is that?
This? How long have you been smoking?
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
Can I watch?
Can I use the bathroom?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Train. It took eight hours.
Very dramatic, I thought.
I'm not pregnant.
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
And you said yes?
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
But you were.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Sang.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
Like what?
Call the police.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
She thought it was me.
Yeah.
Excuse me?
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
I'll assess all I want!
Yes.
They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
What's your point?
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
What smells like shoe polish?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
What do you mean?
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
Blasphemy.
The Emperor.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
Can we talk about this later?
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
All of them.
Why'd you apologize?
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Can we not talk about this?
We're not playing in the street.
How? When?
Jesus.
It's today.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
Broke his neck.
Who found him?
You know.
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
I'm not. She just left.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
Thirty-seven.
I should shit or get off the pot.
Fuck you.
Lovely story.
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Thanks.
Jesus.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Got one. Just pulled up.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
I don't have love handles.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
I don't know.
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Why did you agree to come in then?
Bunch of savages in this town.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
"Be there?"
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
And I actually date you?
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Including you; yes.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Three.
Three including you.
I'm not the pig you are.
No; who were the three, besides me?
Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
How many?
This is different. This is important. How many?!
Lower your voice!
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
A few?
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
Really?  You're the best.
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
WHAT?
I didn't do that!
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
Because he's out of shape.
I'm not sad.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
What?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
My pleasure.
Hey, about everything that happened with Sarah.  I know you did what you could--
Sure you can.
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Patience my love, patience.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
Flare up of old emotions...
He doesn't want my help.
For the same reason you did, to help.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
Making things real rough for Hal.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Want me to lead?
Breathtaking.
Jess, c'mon...
I don't know.  I don't know.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
Forget it!  I refuse!
RUN, DAMMIT!!
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
Anyone else following?
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
Appreciate it.
Been punished, yeah?
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
And you, sir?
Thank you, sir.
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Who are they, sir?
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Well, how are you then?
Let me get up.
And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
Yes sir.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
Yes!!!
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Good. What do you want?
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Prison custody?
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Big, big money.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Travel...and things.
How often you go?
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Sorry?
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
You guys been holding hands?
What thing?
So?  It was a random thing.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
You're gonna cheer up.
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
It's not that kind of job.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.
Max.
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
I think so.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You said you were visiting friends!
What else calms you down?  Candy? Cigarettes?  Sex?  Breathe.
Play music.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
What'd he do to you?
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
You're a cabby.  Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
Lenny, my dispatcher.
Yeah.
People in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Draws attention, which is something you avoid in my line of work.  And for <u>you?</u> You attract attention, you're gonna get people killed who don't need to be.
I listen to classical.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
No.
Leave me alone.
You go every night?
Don't start.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
Yeah?  What happened?
Why?
In case <u>who</u> checks?
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
No.
It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think.
You had to kill Heller?!
What's at Union Station?
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
Why the hell not?
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
I can't promise you anything.
No.
Really?
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Them who?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
A water main broke.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
Come on.
I don't understand.
At a horse show.
You saw me standing alone ...
Without a love of my own.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
Well, I don't know if --
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
You've asked me that one three times.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
We're very specialized.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
I don't believe you.
I don't understand.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
This doesn't make sense.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
I don't think so.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
There's no plug to pull.
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
I'm willing to take that risk.
You know why I'm here.
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
What?  Why?
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
What?
This... seemed best.
Right.  Well.
Good luck, David.
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
And a hundred mile airspace.
That's terrific, but there's one problem:  we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Because I can't.
But what do I say?
Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Can you show me?
Now... you go home.
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
I didn't realize I was out.
-- of Hadden Industries.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
We could be together again --
But what about your research -- ?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
That you, Valerian?
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
'My father's house has many mansions.'
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Something like that.
You're willing to die for this.
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
I do.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
We work down in the ditch?
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
I call.
'Bout two hours left.
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
A Lucas Jackson.
Cool Hand Luke.
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Damn.
Oh for...
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
Work with me.
But it's a different m.o.
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out.
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Okay.
Lieutenant  Quinn.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
I like women like that!
Tell it to your shrink.
My promise.
Yessir.
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
Or the F.B.I.?
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Can I give you a lift?  I somehow find myself driving again.
Isn't that rather too close...?
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
I can drive.
Yes.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
I did this already.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
That's thanks to all your help.
But what am I going to do?
I can't.    I can't see him there.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Tomorrow?
Mottled really.   Green and red.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Very romantic setting.
Guess.
What are the delusions like?
Aren't you ever quiet?
Really?
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
Promise?
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
You should go.
She's only known the guy a few months.
I'm calling in sick.
Yeah.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Yes, I suppose so.
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
No...
Who?
No.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
A pass.
No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Marcel?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Good.   I'm good.
-- Super what?
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Uh, no --
But you were there?
I know they won't be home tonight.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
What kind of business?
And the Vodka.
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
You didn't buy batteries?
I can't believe you didn't check.
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
I will.
It's me.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Everything?
Boy, you must be pissed.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Good song though.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
What room number?
Yes.
What is it you do, Sami?
You lived there. You know the city.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
They sort of got away.
No.   It's mine.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
No thank you.
Watch this.
And you don't speak French?
Thanks.
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Okay.    Okay.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
What's it to you?
I'm just playing around.
I'll never live as a thief!
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Long.
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You're not married, are you?
What do you think?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
You're probably right.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Kneel!
Then you have no use for the sword.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Let them look.
Yes.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
No, not yet...
She needs direction... and training.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Who ever made that.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
It can't rain all the time.
It's just the dope, don't worry
You're not gonna come back, are you?
She's still dead.
Oh.
I don't know you.
I'd like to get in touch with him.
I don't know you...
Take the dope, too.
Another jolly nickname?
I can see her.
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
The night is young.
From who?
Forever.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
No thank you.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I said I was sorry.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Who?
What?
Reading.
You're not gonna start that again.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
I do.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Lighten up.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
What do you mean?
No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
I don't know.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
And then I can go home?
I know.
No. This is going to be our last session.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Who told you?
Baby?  Right on time.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
I'll be in touch.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Yeah?
Outstanding.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Sounds intriguing.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Oh come on. For her first time?
Annette?
Get out!
War it is.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
Not at all. What's wrong?
Ronald? That's crazy.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
I've already told you, she's not home.
She's out.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Excuse me?
Did she show up?
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
You're a lucky guy.
She really loves me.
You bastard!
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year  St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
How?
Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
Yes, darling.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
What do you mean?
Well, it seemed to me --
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed  but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
But...
No.
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
That's right!
That one's an elm.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
But she's dead!
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
Look at me.
My daughter died long ago.
Anybody could know that song.
Good night...Barbara...
Now, I don't know Amy --
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
I've been working out.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
Frida, grab that red one.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Peter keeps asking me out.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat.
That's great. Highly original.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
Yeah right... You better go.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
A little.
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
There's a lot of that going around.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
Like what?
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
No. Nope, nothing in it.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
Is that how you feel?
I love you too.
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Tell her I'm eating.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What makes her think that?
Did we get those DNA tests back?
What kind of animal?
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
Spinning backwards?
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
He's seriously disturbed...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Just like that?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
I see...
Sorry, sir.
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Good.
Fine.
Well be more careful, please.
Shut-up.
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Yes.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
How do you know I'm innocent?
They're dead, John.
No more than the usual.
Don't worry about it.
And we're going away for a holiday.
... Alright.
Share...
Nightmare...
Mild stroke?
Up and around?  Soon?
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Fine.
Check his kids.
Clean.
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
I don't think so.
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
Bob...
Don't do this.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Jesus...
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
We're not upset with you, Dave.  We think you did a terrific job.  Don't we?
I'm not sure... I might have.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
What?
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Does it make the cars any better?
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
Yeah.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
Uh...
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Mind if I sit down?
Truman used it all the time.
Oh... Okay.
What?
I run a temp agency.
I know.
I can't.
I know.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Leave him.
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
Maybe.
Come on!
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
What'dya get?
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
They're townies?!
Knox Overstreet.
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
No, I've been calm all my life!  If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
Garden?
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
I couldn't stop myself.
But I thought-
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
Yes sir.
I think you're sweet.
what?!
If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled.  Stand up.
It does?  What?
Chet...
I gotta find Chet.  Make yourself at home.
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
A madman.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Yes sir.
I don't.
I'll take him over mine.
Nothing.
Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
Yes.  But
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
This play?
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Do you have to quit the play?
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
With who?
The thieves.
I'm their ride.
He's with them.
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
I'm saying they're calling the shots...
We can't just leave them here.
Not like him.
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Me??
...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games...
I have been.
Joey...
A passenger...
Like Mamooli's country...
Maybe plans changed...
Those are mine!
They did not!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
You don't!
I do!!!
It won't open.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Here. Hit it here.
Worse since she talked to who?
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
How was huntin'?
Yeah?
Sit down. Here. Right here.  Albert! Vince!
Worse since she talked to him.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
No. No, no.
Merle, I wanna go home!
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Right.
Yeah.
Fucking A.
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
What do you mean?
See you Monday.
What's that noise?
Listen, Nick --
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
It's not socks, Sal.
Merle gave me this?
Phantom Mary?
Never one.
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Kimberly!
Fuck you - fuck you.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
When you bring in Doucet.
Remember my promise.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Telephone repairman.
Fine.
You sure?  I can help you.
Pass.
I'll be okay.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
What else did he get?
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
I'm signing off.
You never want to find out.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
You're lying.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
No, Stone!
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
You are afraid!
Look here now--
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Yes -- at midnight.
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Why of course --
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
The only one you missed -- is the President.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
Well -- yes --
Shake!
Jabez --
Isn't that your own fault?
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Hard luck -- like me.
Helps sometimes to say it.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
So, why didn't you come?
Mind if I play some tunes?
I'll find someplace.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
Only if New Jersey counts.
I'm a cop from New York.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
So I've heard.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Two?  Are you sure?
Thanks...partner.
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
Roy?
How do you know?
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Well, how'll I get home?
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
Where you gonna go?
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
What am I supposed to do?
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!  To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in?
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
Yeah... yeah!
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
What kind of things, Leon?
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
What are you doin' in there?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Sonny-boy, one word?
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
You tryin' to fuck me?
You're full of shit ...
Okay ...
Give me the keys...
Well, they go to guard school.
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.

I'm sorry.
No, not until after they killed him.
Because I don't want cancer.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
Get 'em in the vault!
I want him to think that.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
We're not there yet.
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Okay.
I speak what I feel.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
I said you were never a faggot.
Maybe...
No!
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>
You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch!
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
Not really.
...THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!
We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Two dollars!  Forget it!
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
That's it?
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
I'm coming.
What are you so worked up about?
You are too crude.
I might be, but you're not welcome here.
I'm getting paid...
...peanuts.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
That's my name.
Do I have to spell it out?
Depends.
Can't do.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
I would like to get paid now.
Do we now?
My salary.  Two-fifty.
Keep it.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
I can run out and get it.
You a blue-moon fool.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
It's e-vit-able.
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
We're outta here.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
I like Mookie a lot.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Yeah, I think.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
HARRY Dunne.
Would you like something to drink?
What?
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
I go to school where I live.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Me too!
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
Go fish.
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Your mom made a move on me.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
Will not.
I will stop this car right now.
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
...cause you said...
Our own special bus.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
You can't marry my mom.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.
You have beautiful eyes.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Me, me, me!
Yeah, that's why I asked.
You certainly did.
Do you know what this means?
You're a great teacher, Lloyd.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
And with that complete loser
Okay. Which one do you want?
Damn! What are the odds?
What?
Try one in a million!
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Oh, you're good.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
He passed away three years ago.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
No.
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
What the hell are you talking about?
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
And you are great in bed.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
This is my son, Paul.
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
They said you were dead.  They said...
No, but many consider my training valuable.
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Your Reverence.
Always?
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
Where?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
Oh, tract housing, huh?  I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>.  I still don't know where to hang the towels!
No.
Ha!
Of course!
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Don't you have any savings?
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
These shoes are itchy.
And who may you be?
We'll do our best.
What?
Ed, it was only one review.
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
I told you this was gonna happen.
<u>I didn't dump you</u>!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
<u>Dr. Acula</u>!
It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Who?
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
I don't think he's a schmuck.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.
Why not??
How long's he been here?
This is my thirteenth pair.
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.
STOP!
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Who's Dr. Tom?
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
Yes!
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
Isn't that the same thing?
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
What if I'm vomiting?
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Come on...
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
What?!
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Okay, I'm nuts.
You know what would be great?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Ed, do you want my advice?
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Al!
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Yeah?
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
What's the difference?
Oh God. What hospital?
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Our foibles, our foibles!
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
You batted or you bunted?
Dynamite.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Yeah, well...
So...?
Really? 
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
I'm sorry.
No... Could you?
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
What?
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
We're excited.
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
I know.
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Hi.
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
Sure.
Ohh... do you own a cat?
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
pierdo.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
Thank you.
Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.
Yeah?
Tracy.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
Doing what?
Would you sign it for me?
You will.
Sure.
Here?
You're there.
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
I also like bananas.
If you say so.
Larry, you just take it easy
What?
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.
Sure, Tracy.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
Dudley, what do you want?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
How?
Sure, boss.  Sure you can.
Five minutes.  That's all.
Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Dudley's guys.
What?
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
What about him?
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
Richard Stensland.
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
No.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
What do you mean?
Yeah, so...
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
I don't have time.  I have --
Believed what?
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Man, what're you saying?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
No.
His blood's always up.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
What about you?
What?
I want you to follow Bud White.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
No.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
You, me and White, huh?
On what evidence?
I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
Is she?
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
I just called it.
They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
Who are you calling?!
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
I'm doing a transfer now.
They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
What do they have to do with this?
The NSA?
You're crazy.
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
They're spooks.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
No shit.
What if--
I called my wife!
How'd you have the manpower to--
Yeah.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
You sure?
Yeah, I can see where that'd--
It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
Shit.
Are you sure about this?
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Thanks.  Who are you?
About the accident.
Somebody took my blender.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Was he with anyone?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
Just for the criminals.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
Something bad happened tonight.
What do you mean?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Robert--
It's not true.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
Stacy--
That's gonna end tonight.
It's a brand new card.
Why the hell would I--
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Not that much.
He doesn't work that way.
That's temporary.
I'm gonna fix it.
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Seat 74.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
What are you talking--
Are those my Christmas presents?
Sure, go ahead.
Where've you been?
Why don't you give 'em a call.
Table 122?
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
He's heard that it's escalated.
Why would they--
I don't know. I mean--
So do I!
How can I reach you?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
Dean's with Lyle.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
No thank you.
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
No.
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
No.
That makes it harder still.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
I know.
Still a car.
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
Which we've overflown twice.
Own the desert.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
Fine.  I'm not looking.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
She can take you as far as Florence.
I can get in the back.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Oh, all over.
Moose.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
What?
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
I can already see.
Could I have a cigarette?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
Kip's another one.
Never heard of it.
Hana, I know you do!
I don't think so.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
So I follow the wires?
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
It's what I've learned.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Go away.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
This was your garden?
I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
Interesting theory. Where's the proof?
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
No you can't.
How about if you try disappearing.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
I'm not the one to ask...
Certainly not mine. Come on.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Something like that.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
In eye of that painting.
Okay, 80-20--
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
Parachute.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  What matters isn't what's real. It's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
Who?
All of them.
What's your point?
So you say.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
Five million dollars.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
So what made you think it was?
A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
It's not about working hard --
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me.  After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
Here what comes?
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Not anymore.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
PG& -- Are you sure?
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
How would you know?
Keep your voice down.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
What's going on?
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
Yeah.  Who are you?
What?
Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
The Emperor?
And code the signal to my private chamber.
Soon, Lord Vader.
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
The boy is our last hope.
Ben ... Ben ...
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
He will join us or die, My Master.
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
Yes.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
I'm against that.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
You don't look angry.
That's quite a compliment.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
Who's staring?
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
That's two you owe me, junior.
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
I've never seen it fail.
Why not me?
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
That they are.
But I feel The Force flowing!
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
No!
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
Never.
But we saw Earth destroyed.
And we can watch ...
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
Humans?
I tried...
Where's Plissken?
All right, so I made another deal.
I'm here.
Does he know how to activate it?
I said pull over.
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
You're running out of time.
...I saw nothing.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
What?!
What's this, what's this?!
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
Rise, Mordred.
And you cannot love me...
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
You.
Love demands it.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
It is.
Can it truly be used for magic?
I'm not jealous!
People make you laugh?
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
How about Lankaster Merrin.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Burke.
Sure you won't change your mind?
No, she was heavily sedated.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
All right then we've got clean rats.
What man?
Lies?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Sure did.
You wouldn't.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
But how?
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
It's fine really, sit.
In Europe.
Have you told him what's happening?
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
You know how?
Captain Howdy.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Listen, I don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all eternity and they love me.
So what's wrong with her?
No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
It would bring us together.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Amen
Amen
I once did a paper on it
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Come on!
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Give me the keys!
Give me the keys.
No.
Yeah, come on in.
Two at a time?
Go fuck yourself.
My pleasure.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
You're their uncle.
Try the black Knable.
Your older brother.
Her hands.  Like that.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
I don't know what you mean.
The hell you don't.
No.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
Get out of here!
I told you I was gonna hit you.
Here, how's this?
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
Yeah.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Because I can hear it.
What?
Time flies, huh?
No. Why?
She's a big girl.
What?
I told you.  It's a useless talent.
He was just having fun.
Nothing. We get nothing.
You don't know?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
What?
What?
This'll kill 'em.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Yeah?
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
So what'd you think?
The audience was a little off tonight.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
I'm sorry?
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
Yes, it is.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Uh ... we'll let you know.
When we know.
Where's my name?
Do I look like I'm naked?
What's wrong with it?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Save it for your wife.
Uh... good.
They're nines.
Jack?
Smells like fish.
Wow. You ever see her again?
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
Uh, well ...
Thanks.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Right.  In there.
Is that the way it is?
So why's he do it?
How's egghead?
How do you know?
Who's Nina?
Ed? How many people live here?
Soap?
You're kidding.
So, what happened?
I guess it's getting serious.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
... Thanks.
My place.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
How old is he?
It's important.
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
And you wouldn't be.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
What happened?
What?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Gone?
You always say that -- then you leave.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Wheres my real dad?
I dont know...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Thats where you work.
Kates my wife...
She wants to have an affair with me.
Hey, is that really necessary?
I never won anything in bowling.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
Hey...
I've got everything I need.
Give me my goddamn life back!
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Need a nurse?
Are we what, Jack?
Howd you do this year, Tony?
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
What?
Yeah...fine.
I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
HEY!
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...
Really.
Maybe youre not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
You had a heart attack?
Ill fix it.  Ill go out right now and get you something.  Ill make it right.
How do you even know about this place?
Are you okay, Jack?
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Its good to see you...
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
And God love you for it.
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Kate? No, theres no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?
Last night was great...
Tonight.
I've got plenty of places to go.
This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...
I had it at four.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you.
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
Is it safe?
Johnny.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Not at all.
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Medical's ready.
Not until the very last second. We must think of something... Something to save the situation.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
And if it should take more time to get through --
That's what they pay me for.
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
Yes...
If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve...
You left something out.
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute.
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
It's too late!
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
Send the following message...
That makes two of us.
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
I'll do what I can.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
Certainly.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
Huh?
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Oh, geez.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, yah, I know that!
Oh, don't be silly.
White Bear Lake?
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
And what about the other fella?
Yeah!
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
but do you know that for sure without -
Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Jerome Lundegaard?
Good day, sir.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Okay.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
...Huh?
We're good to loan in.
Yah.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
The heck d'ya mean?
Nope.
No way.
Yah, that's a good one.
Oh, yah?
Aw, Norm.
Just a Diet Coke.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Nope.
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
Norm?
His wife?
So... they didn't...
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Copy.
We've got a -
Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
No, no.
Norm, that's terrific!
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
He was killed in action.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
Look at my face.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
I'll ask the questions, son.
You need to lighten up.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
The girl had done her homework.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
It suits you.
Do you care?
Can I come in?
What?
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
You are an insane person.
Marla...
Oh, yeah.
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Is this a test, sir?
What?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
I mean -- for a living.
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
Thank you.
Being clever.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Don't I?
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
"I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
If you could fight any celebrity?
Good answer.
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Promise you won't.
Yes, I promise.
Promise?
Don't mention me.
You quit?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
No.
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
You know what I mean.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
Tyler...
"Training?"  Tyler...
Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
And, sometimes you control it...
It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
She's... you... you're fucking her.
You... you can't be serious about this.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
...to let this happen!
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
I think this is about where we came in.
I'm doing this for us.
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
What?
Appreciate something.
No!
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
Blow me.
Take my van!
I've got to stop and help those people.
May we come in?
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
Hold on.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Nothing is... anymore.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
One hundred.
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
There are no worse places.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Fermented fish sauce.
What's that?
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
Duck soup.
How much we got left in that minigun?
Why'd they want us?
Invulnerable.
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
We just take pictures?
About 22 hours on site.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
It's not necessary.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
What that?
De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
What did you want?
I say we tape him to a chair.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
Fine.
Meeting ... people.
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
You're all right... you sure...
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
You can ask.
Fine.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
No, I have to work.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Well there....  What's the difference?
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
Free?
How much?
Where -- ?
They said you're The One.
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
You really want to help me?
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
In a bar called Hellfire.
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
I don't like horror movies!
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
You're married.
No, I...
I leave it to you.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
You're playing the other side.
Yes.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I'm sorry.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
You'll be gone, period.
Who said I was depressed?
I don't know.
What?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
How do you know it's clean?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
No. We have tomatoes.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
Well, you seem very professional...
I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty...
No.
No kidding.
Very nice.
Everybody still up on the Island?
Don't tell me about this...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
Like what?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Where's Catherine?!
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
I guess you fell in the water.
You had no inner feeling?
Then I must have been supplying it.
I think it's what you think.
I don't think that's accurate...
That's right.
I have to talk to you.
I'll be back later...
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
What?
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
All right, let's have a rematch.
Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
I don't think that's true.
You better hold onto your tongue!
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Well, she was.
Perhaps...
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Fine.
Look at me.
Alright.
You know somebody around here?
You look good.
Good. I'm faithful to them.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
Where you goin'?
Eddie from Compost?
Okay, then dance. Show.
What she look like?
She didn't say she had no man.
I'm a good friend of hers.
Probably.  One of the many.
What?
You live around here?
You gotta girLfrLend?
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
You're kidding.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
What'll it be Fletch?
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Mrs. Smith.
Margaret.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Just relax.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, dont you?
You gonna nail the chief?
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Since he moved to L.A.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Of course they are.
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Its okay. The cops did it.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
Sure you did.
Because we can't.
I'm all ears.
I want you to murder me.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
You sure those doors will be open?
Deal.
'Magic' today, huh?
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
Nothing to it.
I'm sorry?
His bride. Cute as a button.
Cute thing.
No, thank you.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
You were in the war?
He never sees them and I never met them.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
What does all this mean?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
I'll take you to a game.
I want to hear this.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
One.
I would, actually.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Irwin...
...never reads the paper...
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
Jim Swarthout?
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
I said, I ain't got you...
I ain't -- got -- you.
Nuthin'.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Johnny's C.D.?
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Why have you come to my planet?
There's that question...
I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Really?
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Fine!
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
Shock.
Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
I wasn't looking.
Goodbye.
... Salvatore?...
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
He is not wrong.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
S'right.
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
We put him to bed for the night.
Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
What is that old building?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
I been damn careful up to now.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
I'll go find Hayes.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
Elvis has left the building.
Did he?
Wish you weren't.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
W...B...2...YXB.
29-years ago.
What's happening?
Yeah...I think so.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
October 12, 1969.
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
What?  What is it?
What kinda twisted animal.
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
What are you talking about?
I don't know...  What about the other women?
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
Yeah, you betcha.
I'm right here, Dad.
In my pocket.
Please, Dad, just do it.
Huh?
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
Nothing you're willing to do.
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Look who's talking.
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Don't do that to me!
Will you come with me?
Be a man, man.
You go ahead...
Your bed.
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Are you all right, Shelly?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
In that little thing?
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Don't say any more.
My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
Whaddya mean?
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
I hope so.
Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
Nancy.
Are they grown-ups?
You gotta be kidding!
Will you listen, dammit!
Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
Legs giving you trouble?
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
So's he and he knows it.
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Tell me.
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Oh my God, Steven.
Randy, c'mon!
I didn't kill her!
-- Bad?!
A pizza?!
Really?
More or less. It's part of my college fund.
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
This is Jason's fault!
Nothing.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Just felt a little chill.
I gathered that.
What do you mean???
Please, hurry...
Very big.
Alla puttanesca.
Tonight. What's tonight?
You mean because What's-His-Name.
And he was there?
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
I think we Nought to wait.
That was a big mistake.
It's your best play, Nicky.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
You're not making sense. Make sense.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
Does what feel comfortable?
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
It can't be all that personal.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
That's completely crazy.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Daddy, wait.
It's only our first date.
Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
See, Daddy.
Who the hell cares?
And you've been extremely patient.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
Life is real.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
My back is killing me.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
What do you want me to do?
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
I want to believe.
Because faith is rewarded.
This could be it!
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
How come?
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
Yes, Peter.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Yes.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
Hm.  Is it?
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
It's split the Government.
Thank you. No.
He's "discovering" India.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time.
Grudges?
--What <i>about</i> his profile?
What a pity.
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
What's wrong with him?
You have more in common than you know.
What about this?
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
The Mission Director.
So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
How long do you stay up there before you go?
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
I'm sure I could have.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
You may as well invite her here.
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
Not that.
Last night?  I was at home.
Who are they?
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
Antonio--
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
No applause!
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
Where do you want to go?
Good.
Boring.
I bought you a lot of new things.
You got the parole, didn't you?
Yeah... I know.
That doesn't hurt.
At least you were outside.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
Who's she?
I'll bet you can.
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Can we make it?
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Yeah.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
No, I'm afraid not.
I never have any luck.
Where?
Whatever you need.
What do you have in mind?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Then you do it.
Why not?
You got it.
That right?
I Just want to find a suitcase.
I know.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Who?
Nothing. What could I do?
This is my brother's car.
Was he?
What about?
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
Good evening.
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
You know Sid Fletcher?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Sure I'm sure.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
No. It's all right.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
You sure?
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Pension him off.
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
No chance of that.
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
How could I stay away?
Eric. Eric Paice.
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?  Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
Scotch, please.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
Shut up.
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
Three hundred altogether?
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
Deadbeats all.
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
I...I don't know.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
You're on this...
Some contest board...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
For some sales pro...
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
No.
Nurses.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
What act?
You...
Somebody...
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
How do you know he'd buy them?
No, we're just...
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
Is that what I said?
What did he say?  He'd buy them.
What?
What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
What does that mean?
...and rob the place...
How ya doing?
Uh-huh.
Huh?
He said he filed...
They stole the...
At home.
Thieves.
Where did Moss...?  I...
Did they catch...?
That's great.
I want to work today, that's why I came...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
Levene!
The people downtown said...
Get in the goddamn room.
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...then...
And what if you don't close.
I will close.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon.
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
Why I don't...
Excuse me...
What are you talking about?
Five thousand.  I kept half.
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
You sold eight Mountain View?
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
Twelve-fifteen.
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
I don't know.
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
To change our minds.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
Yest...
It's not me, it's my wife.
I told you.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I...
Why not?
They took 'em...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Yes.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
Three.
Yes.
Do you like them?
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
She couldn't decide.
I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
He is weak.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before  You're too quiet for your own interest.  I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable.  No hard feelings, eh?  If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
Let's go.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
...Who?
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
He's an Italian?
Beautiful.
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
She's gone, Tom.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
Will you tell him?
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
Connie's outside.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
What was it, so I'll know.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Mike wants it.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
He's going to try Panama...
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Thanks...friend.
I don't think that's necessary.
Does it feel like a boy?
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Where?
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
Who's asking?
Who do you think you're talking to?
But times are different...
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
The money was sent.
Except the President of the United States.
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
When do we talk?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
Sitting right behind you.
We worked it all out beforehand.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
I won't keep you another minute...
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
It still hurt.  A lot.
You will not hurt him?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
Yes.  I trust you.
But I didn't do this!
Mornin'.
And your name is --?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
But why?
It's new.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Can't today.
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
You're talking through your hat now.
You're the one who started it.
Do I look okay?
No.  Definitely not.
Do I have any other choice?
The Great War?
A very lucky thing indeed.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
Not at all.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
Yes.  Perfectly.
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
A visitor.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
Then the rumors are true?
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
You didn't?
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
The business has changed...
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
Double-meaning intended --
Double-meaning intended, right?
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Donny-nothin'!
It's arright ...
Yeah...
There's no one left ...
He's in some trouble ...
Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership...  Imagine us selling cars?
You remember that, Kip?
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
What am I supposed to do?
You all right -- ?
Just hold-on there --
I heard you were pumping gas -
What do you got ... ?
"About what?"
I can see that -
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
He's gonna kill you -- !
You can handle it?
You?
Me.
You?
"Shadow games?"
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Come here -
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
You boost her -- ?
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
What for -- ?
Buy you a drink?
So I was replaced by Mitch?
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
Hey -
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
Are you considering a comeback tour?
Is he still working here ?
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
Liar!
What bag?
He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
Who's gonna do that?
What are you talking about?
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
Oh no! No!  Noooo!
I got seared.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
Don't worry about it.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
Done.
Yeah.
I gotta go home and get my hat.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
That's important.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
Please?
Oh shit.
What are we gonna do up there?
Next week.
Why not?
I don't know.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
No, I had to talk him down.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
How you doin'?
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
I have about seventy-three...
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
What're you doing?
I'm sorry.
That's right.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
I appreciate that.
Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Who proved the theorem.
Pleasure to meet you.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Five.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
--I don't have any anger at you--
I got one of those too.
The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
Whatever blows your hair back.
Tell me what you really think.
What is?
Maybe what mea--
Time's up.
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
My wife's dead.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
They could see that I meant it.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
I guess.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
I know.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
I'll keep in touch.
Here's my number.
What?
Sounds good, where are you now?
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
No I wasn't...
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
They don't come over here that much.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I can't go out to California.
Why not?
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
Goodbye.
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
But ain't no reason--
I'll get Rosasharn.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
You're *ticklin' me!*
Two and a half cents.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Which way is House 25?
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Say, who runs this place?
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
No, I never. What?
Just around that next bend.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Casy! What you doin' here?
Thought you was in jail.
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
What's the matter? What's happened?
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Get to what?
Yeah.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Sure. We aim to.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
That's right. And douse some in it.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Ya say we're acrost?
Since before they stopped us las' night.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
They know he got hit in the face.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
Are you crazy?
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
You do not see either!--not yet!
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
I never--
You don't...
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
It's nice to see you again.
Not much else.
I'm a professional killer.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
You see someone?
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
You met people.
Watched television?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Unbelievable.
As long as I get the laugh.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
Hey, Bob.
That sounds pretty interesting...
Those all seem kind of related...
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
Nope.
I don't think so.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
Yup.
That's going to cost.
In Detroit. This weekend.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
Tell them my house exploded.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
You're leaving me hanging here...
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
Annie!
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
No. I just thought... forget it.
I'll take care of it.
Thanks, honey.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Tom's gone.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Tch. What are you --
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
We're very lucky.
Do you? Do you really?
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Huh-huh. You?
Let's not talk about that now.
What do you mean?
Where to?
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
- See, what you can do for him --...
Of course not.
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
Diane!
We should be fine, then.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
Mmm. An editor.
You're catching on.
It's never too soon to start.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
How's Pilgrim doing?
You shut up, stupid!
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
Long enough.
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
You think it's cool?
Hack the Planet!
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Hackers of the World, Unite!
How are you going to take care of the cops?
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Cereal.
Yeah?
Go fix the phones.
Roger.
I'm taking over a TV network.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
What?
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
What?
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
What? whatwhatwhat?
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
What, it left a note?
Nonono, thank YOU!
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
We're trapped in this house.
Brady!
No. You son of a bitch!
Get up there Rachel!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
Drive Carefully.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
Double scoops?
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Well try dammit!
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
Where are you going?
Got it Ben.
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Be here in a minute.
Sort of.
Uh huh.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Okay. Bye.
Annie, was that you?
Sure, see you later.
Lies.
He can still watch.
I don't want to.
Michael's around someplace...
Will you call me tomorrow?
They may be right.
I'll check back in an hour.
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Sure.
Just watch.
I don't like that story.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
After the movie.
What about the bogyman?
There WAS.
How?
No! Do as I say.
You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
I've given them his profile.
Thorazin.
If you say so.
Mmm?
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
Oh.
What?
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
I can't resist.
I cry at the opera.
They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
...cannot go on the air.
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
No!  No...
Bye.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh, right.
I have been in love with you for so long.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Oh, all the time.
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Was I?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
I didn't say that.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
That thought doesn't terrify you?
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
What are you going to use for money?!
I'm saying it now!
But not you.
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
I bumped into your...
Very good.
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
Yeah?
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
Mh-hm.
Well, then a third opinion.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
How?
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Good.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
I was so bored!
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Yeah.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Right.
I am.  You-you made my day.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
It's all right.
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Hi.
Take our literature...
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
...you don't have to think.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
It's a growth business.
Orderly.
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
Yeah, so where is he?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
...are you alright, sir...?
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
No.  And...
Awright.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
Mmm...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
..suitcase...locker...
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
Waal...
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
My scar is a war-wound.
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
Spoken like a Protestant.
<u>Yes</u>.
The girl needs help.
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
I don't understand.
...what did you want? 
I know where he is.
I know where he is.
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
Brazilian. 
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
...yes...?
Because?
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
You're all making me blush...
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
Gee, thanks.
Because you're an idiot.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
You goddamn bitch!
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
How very.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
S'okay....
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Remember he's left-handed.
Of course.
Did to.
Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
Pretty weird.
Goddamn Geek!
Shut the fuck up, all right.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
What now?
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
steps back.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
Somebody's got to help us!
Saint Mario!
This . . .
It's so beautiful!
What??
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
You mean travel by ourselves?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
I'm stumped.
It's inside a moving car.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
I understand, I think. Other women?
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
What?
Getting paid for doing shit.
Yeah, how's that?
Bret. What the hell is going on?
What's the difference?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
What?
I only married you for your body.
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Ambulance.
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
YOU!
Well now there's a compliment.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
I know a guy who only has one leg.
Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators.  "Keep a low profile," that's my motto.
It was you!  I thought I heard...
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
It's November.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
We're all assholes, Bernie?
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Lie, you mean...
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
Never reach out!
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
No, no, no, no.
I should.
It is tomorrow.
Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
RUDOLF!
I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
Whew.
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
What's that?
Stop knowing me so well.
But it's what we want.
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
Did you hear what he said?
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
Where should I hide the car keys?
His secretary just confirmed.
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
I didn't.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
Can we keep him?
Get on the other side of that.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
I think it was England.
Why?
A few days ago.
Aye.
You?
That is what bothers me.
As friends -- always as friends.
France.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
I stood up first.
She's a treasure she is.
How?
I remember you.
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Then who's Russell Nash?
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
I wanted to get to know you better.
Is it?
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Must you fight him?
Get out.
Conner?
We'll see.
This cannot be.
I know.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
I'll no forget you.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
Why?
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
You can't run with suitcases.
Fuckin' A.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
Yeah.
You said they would be here!
Where is it?
You'd better be kidding.
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
What I want is to help my father.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
What's wrong with the radio?
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
Maddox!  You got that?
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
Special Agent Jones.
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
They're still in the house.
What do you want?
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Six.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Yes we have.
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
Canadian Club?
Will you protect us.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
What do you mean, General?
Today.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
How so.
I committed no war crimes.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
Very good.
You have no whiskey?
Were not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
Thank God.
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
Good for you.  We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
How much?
I will give you my house.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Of course.
Homework?
What?
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Where are you hurt, son?
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
But who is left?
No, no.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
I want to know.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
You have taken business class?
The staff, the guests.
I don't know.
And what's Steven's status?
It's complicated. But don't worry --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
Best of a nightmare.
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
-- where the hell were you?
-- listen to the man --
What --
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
You know everything you do gets me hot.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
Fascinated.
-- no more --
Then who did??
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
He would have been back by now.
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
I'm ok mommy.
For good luck honey.
Did you ever see a leprechaun?
What will Aubrey think?
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
I don't know.  That's strange.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Oh come on!
What about keeping an open mind?
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
I'm ok.
Yes, I am.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
What!
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Thank you.
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
We'll be there.
And what would you do?
There's something through that wall!
And what is ... this frozen moment?
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Where?
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Why are you so interested?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
And he still sits there?
Oh, Terri ...
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
You're JP Monroe, right?
Thank you.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
But how in God's name ...
I miss you too.
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
God go with you, sister.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
How long were you in?
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Oh.  Well, what's this?
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Trust Leonardo....
Wha -- you don't want to know...
I got my planet back.
Actually he never told us what it was.
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
The Hudswinger!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
It's hardly the same --
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
Adenoids?
A sawbuck!
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
I myself --
Why yes, do you know it?
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Smitty.
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
I know that, Amy.
Now, Aim --
Huh?!
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
...Geez.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Huh?! But, buddy --
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Hmmm.
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
You're fired.
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
He don't look wise.
He notices.
...adenoids.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
But you didn't have to come up here.
Yes.
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
I imagined this so differently...
Instead -- you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that.  Don't call it nothing.
She was beautiful.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor.
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make?  Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Got a meeting uptown.
Right o'.
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Um, yes.
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Well?
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Anyone special? You know...
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Yeah.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
You know, dah--
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
A key party?
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Who?
You're not a psycho!
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
It'll warm you up.
I used to know how to cook.
Educated guess.
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
But not too ashamed.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
Do what?
Um, Libbets Casey.
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
No!
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
I dunno. I --
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Her name's Libbets.
And?
They left it in the jungle.
I don't know. How do I know?
What's the D.A. got them on?
That must have been awful for you.
Okay.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
So?
That's right.
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
That's right.
You know I remember that.
Huh?
I told you I don't remember.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Thought you wanted something fun...
Who?
Yes down at the station.
Yes.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
No back-up.
Perhaps...
She is.
Then blame the one who made her...
You said there were none.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Is this my birthday?
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
Claudia, you torture yourself.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
But if she dies...
What do you mean?
NO!!!!!
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
And if I don't?
I don't know any hell -
Paris? You came from Paris?
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
You loved your wife, surely.
But it has. There is no more to tell.
No...
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
Yet. Nothing yet.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Then, don't.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
You're okay. Thank god.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
Will you try...for me, please?
Never do that again.
It's gonna be great.
Wait, it's Nancy --
Are you sure?
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Yes!
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Wanna drink?
The rest of us see bathrobes.
Must have missed the sign.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
Crowded.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
All the graves?
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
I was looking for you.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
Miss Wollsten!
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
What if he is?
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints  the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
Really, this is idiotic!
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
You are my friend.
Well, all right . . .
I hate to do this, fella.
Suicide.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
All right.
Uh-huh.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
I'm all right.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
No, sir.
No.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
I know, but . . .
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
That way, huh?
George . . .
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Five hundred dollars.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Uh-huh.
I'm going to scream!
Where'd you get that dress?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Thank you.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Yeah, just started.
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Oh, George, George!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
We better go back in.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
The rope!  The rope!
Right.
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Please.  It's my job.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Do I have to?
Because.
Okay, okay.
You want to come here a minute?
No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts.
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Can't you tell?
Mrs. Silvera.
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
Nothing.
What'd I say?
That you were fired.
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Going out.
Thank you, thank you.  You know my son, don't you?
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Perfect.  Look at this ---
What?
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
What for?
That's it?
Did you say Cable Junction?
What's daddy doing?
Hiya yourself.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Nope.
Tina Wilcox.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
What about sailing?
I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry.  And cold.  And most of all, bored.
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
I'm not sure I can.
It'll be fun, come on!
You do everything your parents tell you?
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit Loops.
Forget it, he won't listen.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Sure am.
How come?
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Michael, the sub's dead.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Okay.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
Me.
You don't have to prove anything.
Fine.  Have them do some.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I thought they were clever.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Why?
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
They still seem nervous.
Sure.
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
As always.
I don't know, what else is there?
Now what?
Yes, there is goes.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
Oh...
Five hundred yards.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Sure.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Chicken....
I'll be right there.
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
Because....
Henny Youngman....
You caught me....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
You check it....
Thank you....
You're silly....
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
Mother....
I'm just getting started....
Okay.
You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
Why'd you come out here?
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
It could have been an accident....
Sure you can....
Nothing....
I have coffee in the thermos.
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
Still chasing fish?
Will you leave me alone...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
Stop busting my hump....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
Down here....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
What?
How long?
Hoagie.
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
I'm going down, Jake....
She's not going to like it....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
How come only me?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
'Snuck up on me....'
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
Stop that!
My equipment doesn't crap out....
No way....
Don't flatter yourself.... 
In a few minutes....
Who grows more beautiful....
I'm training to....
No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
O.K.
C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is "God's Country," John.
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
Why?
Sure.
No .. You didn't know that ..
I'm asking it.
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
No.
Oh.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
Do you pray?
How d'you know what I'm like?
He said that? What else did he say?
I know.
You know? How do you know?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
You do?
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
Ask him.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
That's right.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Jerry!  Do something --
Listen to me, it's over.
Bill, Rod, wait --
You think so?
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Happy for us.
Thanks.
Call me later, hon.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
I'm relieved you said that.
What?
Good night.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Why do you love me?
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
I understand your anxiety.
No, I'm saying to be --
No, I don't know.
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
Why not --
I think so.
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
What --
She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...
But wait...
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
Don't be silly.
You okay?
Dick.
-- and I'll get 'em.
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
Right up ahead, buddy --
It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
One way to find out.
So do you.
What did you say?
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
Here!
What about Eric?
then we should...
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Baryonyx?
My favorite.
In Costa Rica?
Which one do you prefer?
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
Stan.
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
How do you mean?
No.  I feel something.
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
I don't even know this woman.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
That was about a year ago.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
Come on!
Good lad.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
Funded by whom?
I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Where's Ian?
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
Can the kid walk?
It's not worth taking the chance, John.
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
How am I supposed to transport them?
I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
Not just every six weeks.
- - and swallows fresh ones.
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
They're not here.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
Alan, listen to this.
Yeah.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Tim.
No.
I doubt it.
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Nope.
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
You're sure?!
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
All night.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
Thanks, Dad.
Sure.
Thanks for the presents.
Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Help me with this.
I really think we should go back...
I want to look at the rest of the house.
Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
None of that's true?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
That's open to debate.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Yeah, what is it?
Great.	When can you do it?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
A man must eat --  And drink.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
Did you see him?
And you're late!
I suspected that he -- well.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
-- What could he have done to warrant that?
Tonight?
I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
Why were you given notice?
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
No -- not this time.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
No, I suppose not.
We know that.
What makes you think so?
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
-- You should meet my father.
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
... A piece of paper ...
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
It usually is.
I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
-- You mean my Chief has it.
It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
Oskar.
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
Did he come around often?
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
I'd just be guessing.
Well I have to close up now.
Yes indeed.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
What about everything since?
No thanks.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
Try some other ways. 
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
Don't worry.
I don't get you.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
I was wondering what that was.
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Mm.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
It's in the report.
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
No.
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
I'm sorry.
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
Then eat around it.
No.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
See you in the morning light...
No, she never did.
No.
What did you do when you were little?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
And what is your present salary?
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
And how did you find his work?
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
Was he unfaithful?
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
What about Billy?
So do you.
Joanna, I don't give a--
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
Are you firing me, Jim?
Sure.
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
I'm going to take it.
But it's not a year from now, is it?
Do you want the kid or don't you?
I lost him?  I lost him?
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?!  Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.  You can set your watch by it--
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Where are you from?
Can I do anything I want?
And you have horses? You love horses.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
I have a copy for you.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
I pooped.
I accept it. What is suffering?
What do you think?
Look here!
Can India help us?
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
Good day.
Thank you.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
Is that true or pretend?
And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
I do.
I see that.
No.  Do you?
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
And what would he do come winter?
Cocktail?
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
You're crawling around like a--
They don't really attack underwater and--
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
It came from across the lake.
Then do it!!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
We both know what they'll do.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
You talk to Bickerman?
Just those two.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Could we have intercourse?
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
You flew up here because your boss--
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
I'm sorry but you're...
Good.  See ya soon.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
I didn't say it like that.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Ssssh!
I'm not mushing it.
I'll call the coroner.
Are they feeding?
Obviously I was wrong!
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
It looks like a branch.
You threw it at me!!
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
Wait.
The somebody else part?
Wild guess.
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
<u>You</u>?
Myra.
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
You're all right! Where is he?
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
That wasn't me.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
Miggs has been murdered.
Are you finished?
Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
But if he knew we have so little time -
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
Dr. Lecter...
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
It's much better than your shoes.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Was it a butterfly?
A moth... How did you predict that?
The death of my father.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
Early. Still dark.
But you could. You did.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Absolutely.
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
Why did they turn back?
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry.
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Yes. I want you to go.
I sent three men to Webb!
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
What the bloody hell plan is this?
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
That is the truth!
I don't understand!
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
What did you see, Major?
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
You forget yourself!
And what is that?
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Thank you. How can I reward you?
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
And?
Why Sixpack?
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
He did.
Shit...
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
Where's Doc?!
He's not at his station.
It bit me!
Okay.
What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
Under there?
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
Sixpack...
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
I ought to smack your face!
Oh man, that's just great...
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
Well, it's still a good idea.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
Well what?
You want a pint, go to the pub.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Son, have a look in his locker.
All right, furry muff.
About twenty minutes.
That's no way to answer the phone.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
I'11 meet you in the car.
A hundred grand.
Yes?
I want your bar.
You know it doesn't include the amp.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
That's going on optimism.
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
--you're going to be on your own.
You really want to know, sir?
Thank you, sir.
And you and Private Graves--
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Skinny?
He swore by it.  What?
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
So?
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
Do I seem jumpy?
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
No. You?
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
He never asked her.
The Trail of Tears.
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
You wouldn't?
You own this place?
Lead mine.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Mikey look at this--
They were using M-1's, yeah--
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
Appreciate it, sir.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Aqui! [Here!]
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
This girl has a child?
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Right.
No.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
Do you?
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
The Sheriff.
I was too busy.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
You got in late last night.
It was for personal consumption.
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
The Republicans?
Oh.
Yeah.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
And people better clear out of here! Now!
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
Uh-huh.
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Isn't that French for something?
Deep shit?
I think we make our own futures.
Why not?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
You didn't marry him for love.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
No.
I'm sure.  He's dead.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
And they all came...
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
Good.  There.  Yes?
You saw this?
No word from D'Amour?
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
What makes you so sure?
New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
No.  Not yet...
I heard he was the best.
Philip Swann?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
I don't think the dead much care.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
I tried to pay you off.
I won't say anything.
She has no real grip on reality.
You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
Or murdered, like Nix.
Will that do?  No?
And you're not?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Jesus!
I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Ok.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
How long have you been married?
Oh, what do you do with that?
I'm here for the week.
I know. I don't either.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, you smiled.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
No one ever tells you that...
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
You are.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
Yeah.
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
I don't want to be.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Yes?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
What?
Bye.
Ok, I will... later.
Sushi.
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
Eight.  That okay?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
I think I should join you.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
You ready?
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Just open the door, please.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
I didn't know what else to do...
Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
Trick him.
Yes.
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
No oxygen to the brain.
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
You are the younger of two...
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
There weren't any voices.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
I can manage.
Don't curse.
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
No I don't.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
I don't remember that.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
She's alright.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
Thanks.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
Why are you up?  Get in bed.
To do what you love.
I know...
No.
He's in college?
They ever love you back?
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
Just one word of advice for next season.
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
Kay.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
So that means I have to ride with you.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Your hot-ass temper.
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Good.
You having fun?
Yeah.
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
You sure?
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
I said fine.
My court, I go first.
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
Who's nobody?
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
Stay!
Never had to.
You don't think so?
Few days ago.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Funny.  I never did.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
So...how's the knee?
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy.
You're serious.
What?
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
One game.  One-on-one.
And what happens when you lose?
Hey.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
Keep your voice down.
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
I mean, it's not true, is it?
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
After five years.
Good.
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
Hello, Phil.
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Well what's the situation?
Sure is.  So why call me?
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
About two years ago.
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
That's great, thank you.
I don't have a boyfriend.
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
Good bye.
Yeah.
Great, bye.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
Say what you want and you'll see --
Yes.
Yes.
Sure, why?
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
DAD --
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
Leave this one to the detectives, they ain't gonna solve shit, I can help you, make you the man with a plan, give you the gift that I flow -- think fast -- you wanna know who killed that guy?
No.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
I ain't fuckin with you --
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
What's up?
Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
Well --
I have love.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
You see?
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
I paid you back.
She loves you.
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
Is this 509-9027?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
Muffy -- coffee?
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
Go ahead and waste your time.
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
And that's what you've heard?
Around here.
Hollywood, mainly.
Well I guess it doesn't.
She's retired.
Are you close?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
Is he in pain?
...uh-huh...
About three weeks ago.
I am calm.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
What does it look like?
I don't know a loud crash.
What's this, how did this happen?
No.
I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
I need you to get me Paula --
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
As fast as I can.
Love you too..
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
No.  No.
Will that help?
I'll answer anything.
How long with Paula?
Two years...three years...
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
Well maybe.
I don't know....
...No....
...I don't know...
She's asleep.
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
No they don't --
Are you on drugs right now?
I can't.
Where will the money go?
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
Phone number.
Water.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
Yeah.
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
Should be one-thirty.
I said I'm fine.
Hi.
...what...?
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
He is nothing now.
You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
Making the key to the throne.
Soon enough.  Here we are.
Come, we have a boat waiting.
I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
You can do it.
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
But --
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
You can't do it.
Everyone back.
Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
Why didn't you say so?
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
He lures us to capture.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Yes, your Majesty.
Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
Sire, I --
... Nothing.
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
You mean shut your ass down!
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Yeah?
No.  A witness.
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Yeah.
Where the hell is my car?
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
1490...Breckinridge...
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
Mind if I come along for the ride?
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Ditched you?
That was Peterson upstairs.
What's the bottom line?
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
I have to.
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
Last two like this we had, you caught.
Get him to Atlanta.
I know...
What'd it say?
Get me a plane!
What's it narrow down to?
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
There has to be.
There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
When do you need it?
Francis? Where are you?
No. Reba...?
Me.
No.
No!
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
Yes.
Oh, God.
You will tell the truth?
Dr. Chilton.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
He's right-handed.
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
He asked how you are.
At the store. You doin' some good?
Blue, then.
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
And... where are things?
What's the problem, Molly?
Will?  You could come up here.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
My name's Will Graham. I...
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
You got it.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
There'll be other shots.
I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
Tony Clifton.
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
No thanks.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
You're NOT DYING!
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
What's your name?
It's my name.
You all look the same to me.
The orders were for your protection.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
You don't, do you?
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
Stand up and see for yourself.
How?!
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
Because... I didn't think I would?
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
Yeah.
And she's never wrong.
Yes.
What do you believe in?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
I'm not the One.
You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you.
Of what?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
I'm going in after him.
No, you're not.
Not yet.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
How much time?
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
Cypher, I thought --
Thanks.
Let go of her.
Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Nervous?
No.
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
What do you mean?
I don't like loading crates.
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Nope...
OK.
OK, get in.
C'mon Johnny.
How much was the original loan again?
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
Bye.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Well...
It's still sick.
No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
But...
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Yeah, it's your father's.
Quiet please.
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
But it's your birthday.
And you could care less --
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
It's for the party, Dad --
Drew, you're out of line.
'Here'?
It doesn't matter.
Then why did you bring it up?
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
Do you think I need a haircut?
You have a way with words.
Olympic.
As much as Joe's?
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
Are you?
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Well, that's very interesting.
Yeah.  Neat.
You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Didn't the family get together last night --?
The Board is waiting.
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
No.
Very well, I'll watch.
Yes.
Not now.
I don't know.
Yes...I've found that it does.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
No.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
I don't know who you are.
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
You think so?
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
Make an exception?
So can I.
Are you sad, Bill?
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
You were just curious?
I guess...
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
What's okay?
Just a manner of speaking.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
'Spooning'?
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
Yeah.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
I believe you did.
Quiet.
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Watch it!
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Good morning, Quince.
How're you doing--?
How's that, Quince?
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Hi, honey.
Does Drew tell you everything?
I hope so.
You're only six-five once.
Uh oh --
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
What?!
Raise away.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
I could be her.
Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
No --
From what?
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
I have no memory.
Seen you together, that's all.
Hi, Leonard.
This isn't my room?
No, let's go.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Don't be too hard on yourself.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Quiet!
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
So I just take your word?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Yeah?
What does he want?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
How?
That's different.
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
I guess I've told you about my condition.
Mr Gammell?
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
No! Should I?
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Why would I do that?						    *
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Why would I have a gun?
With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief.
He any good?
Oh, yeah...
Recruit us to do what?
Good.
Where's the new drop point...?
My end?
You do.
When?
Right now.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Good samba dancing...?
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
I know.  And now?
And what do I do with him?
What'd Neptune tell you?
'Cause she will tell you.
Good.  So let's go...
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
I would never doubt you.
What's the point?  It's going down.
That's right.
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
I don't understand...
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
Yes.  What's up?
What flowers?
What's it say?
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Not French registry?
Yeah?
Must be some mess back there.
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
I ain't sleepy.
I show you what problem --
For money for what?
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
You inviting shee-it.
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Don't need a comb.
Yeah.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
Hell, don't cry about it!
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
Getchmis...?
Listen!
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Sixty?
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
Stupid.
But just...
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
How much did you figure to make?
I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest.
What's your father do?
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
That doesn't seem so bad.
Aslan, there... 
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
Yeah!
What?
Cut his fucking throat.
Maybe he's changing jobs.
That's a great philosophy.
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to your right...
Right.
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
Depends.  You got a memo?
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
You know what I mean...
Just do it!!
It worked before...
Try not to sweat?
I know.  Help me get a sample.
What do you want to know?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain. 
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
If you wouldn't mind.
Oh, like I could do that?
No, what is it?
I'm getting to believe you.
The Sistine Chapel?
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Great.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
No, just the paper will be fine.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
I'm telling you, I can't.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
It's perfect.
To Misery.
I'm glad you like it.
Four or five days ago. Why?
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
What thing?
You think he might be missing?
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
Great.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
Sean, please..
How I usually find you, Nyah.
Mmmm.
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
More like two-two point two million.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
..or hard wired..
How much longer before you can reach him?
Oh, either way works for me.
- right..
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
They've got a book for everything.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Just like old times?
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
You mean it'll be difficult.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Yes, I gathered as much.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
I'm fine..
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Don't move.
What?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
What kind of help?
You didn't have to.........
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
Theyíre dead.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I wouldn't dream of it.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
My contact is extremely shy.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Jack.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
He won't be back in a hurry?
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Youíre probably right.
Jack you're so wicked.
What?
I want you to stop seeing her.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
You did this once it didn't work out.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
What'd you do to your hair?
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
How'd he die?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
You think so?
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
I was dead, too.
Loretta.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
I've never seen a moon like that.
It makes you look like an angel.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
But he wants me to come!
No. I'm gonna wait.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Will you marry me?
Yes, on the floor.
Alright.
How near is she to death?
Alright. A month. In a month.
A month from today?
Sure.
How was your plane ride?
Why not?
Pop don't like Johnny.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
What's the matter with him?
I know.
He should pay.
I don't know.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
Yes.
You don't know where Loretta is?
Will you join me for dinner?
That woman was a student of yours?
Sure.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Marriage is happy news.
What? What?
Look.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Well, who is your lord?
Oh!
All right!  What do you want?
Come on then.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
No.  No.  No!
What does it say?
A Grail?
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
Behind the rabbit?
Charge!
Man!
What?
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
Shut up!
You're not.   You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.
Do me a favour.
What is your name?
I don't know that!
Here's one!
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
But, Mother ...
But I don't like her.
I'm ... your son ...
Got it?
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Shut up.
Seventy a year.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you.
Aye.
Louder, girl!
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
I'm flattered you think so.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
That's not good enough.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
Yes.  I do.
Dare say you can be taught.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
Maybe, once.
Then I envy yo.
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
Too busy looking after themselves.
She'll never understand it.
She's well, too.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
He thought so, yes.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
What does he know about the Highlands?
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
Yes.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
From whom?
He?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Yeah...
No, in person.  Now.
I'm coming over.
You imagined it.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
I know.  It sucks.
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Got it.
What?!  There's nothing here!
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
Hold my keys, then.
The game will guide you.
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
And?
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Will you meet with him?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Howdy to you.
How's that?
One.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
I was afraid of that.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
What?
Number 17.
No...I need to sleep.
I don't know who I am.
What do you mean?
Okay.
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
Good luck!
Do you know them?!
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
Yeah, what for?
Not a coke or anything?
I'm working on it.
What ?
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Is this really the time ?
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
Let's go.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Yes.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Hey , Hey !
I told him not to sit down in there.....
Trust me, if you open any door, you'll be dead a whole lot sooner.
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
Thanks...
Yes, sir Mom. 
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
I just want to double check the facts.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
Sir ?
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
What did you hear ?
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
I'm listening.
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Sure.
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
Where are we ?
Come to the rescue again I see.
Good morning.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Are you writing a poem?
No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Don't mention it.
What do you remember about her.
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Great.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
How about a nice glass of milk?
Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
O.K. Thank you very much.
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
Vada.
Just come and get it...right here!
Leave me alone!!
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
For the mini-bike fund.
No problem.
Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
This is it I guess.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
Okay.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
You know how I feel about you.
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
Something wrong?
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
He's a great poet.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
Good for you baby.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
What?
Yes.
No.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
What happened to her?
Did she ever see Vada?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
Good.
Goodnight.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Is it for a child?
Dad??
What are you doing.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
No sweetheart, you can't.
He was allergic to bees.
Get away, get away!!
Really?
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
I'm very nervous.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
Get away from me!
We'd love to hear it.
Do you think she is?
Does he love her?
My Dad was funny?
Chocolate?
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
He won't give it to me.
What are they about?
Can I use your bathroom first?
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Are you here to take Shelly back?
I'm hemorrhaging.
They're just fun to read.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
I can't, I have to go home.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Naah, I don't wanna.
You have no personality.
It's my mother.
Duck!
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
Stand back.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
They're getting married?
He likes her better than me.
You can come to my house for dinner?
No, I'm hiding out.
Uh huh.
Okay on the count of three.
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
Part of being a New Yorker.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
I have a suggestion...
You've been working on this, huh?
Impressive.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
Ben Gay.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
You win.
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
... whatever is manly and independent.
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
Have you ever heard of. Irony?
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I can't wait for you to meet her!
... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
What, leaving school...
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Never can tell.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
It's two weeks.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
Like family, huh?
What is that sup...
This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
Well, that just happened that time.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Then why are you listening to her -
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
Well, my wife, Ester's down the hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I was just talking to Ester about your being here.	She loves you so much, I just had to come down and say hello. We've been following you since you were a girl. Well, I just scared you to death. I didn't mean to do that.
You'll have to speak up.
Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
She's fine.
How is that?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
What does he want?
It's on National television, Barnett.
President.
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
Where the hell have you been?
What crook?
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
She's in Paris.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
That Tom sure is cute.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Nashville.
I don't think so.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Tom. You remember?
Yes.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
Hi.
I don't know who you are.
Oh?
Oh.
Well...
That's what you said before.
Fifteen minutes?
Hundreds of times.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
For him?
You're not.
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Probably a little too long.
He ain't really new.
He is to a lot of people.
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
I'll be dammed.
You bet.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Oh, why thank you.
I see.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
Yes, you are.
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback...
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
Ain't love grand.
She was born without a tongue.
Oh my God!  Sorry.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
So, what now?
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
I do, too.
They've hypnotized the nation.
That's the way of the world.
Just for fun, I guess.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
The entire wing?
Scotty?
And where do you keep Mickey?
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Yeah.
They done that too long in my family.
It sure is.
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
I don't know. He's your boy.
How 'you doing?
Oh yeah?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
In Birmingham.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
No thanks.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Take it easy.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
You almost got into trouble back there.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really makin' it now.
Just for the day?
I'll have some coffee, please.
Come here, baby.
You didn't answer my question.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Don't look so scared.
Yeah.
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Yeah!
Day work.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
What 'you signifyin'?
I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
Sorry.
She don't look no worse to me.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Good-bye, Duff.
All right, son.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Anything you say, baby.
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
Don't play with me.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
Dixie McCoy
What are you talking about?
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
What about McCoy?
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Right...
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
What?
Can you take me to it?
You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
We got problems topside.
Less than thirty minutes.
How's the ice?
Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
And Linda...
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
I'm late for lab.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Jos, that's not what we're --
That is lingerie.

No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
You crossed over.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
Hey--I can be out of control.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
OUT!
He's my teacher!
Don't you remember what they called you?
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
That's the spirit!
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
Really?
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
I know.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Do you think you'll find her?
But now you don't have to--
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Everybody knows about--
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
No.
He stayed a long time.
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
What about it?
They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
No shit.
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
How come?
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
I know.
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
About not finding any bogey men?
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
Huh?
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
I'm sure you would.
He's full of shit.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
Jennifer --
Deal.  Thanks.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
I don't do that shit.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Thanks, Max.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Sounds like a rough time.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
That's what I know.
So do I.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
For what?
The truth.
Try me.
Everybody take five.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
No...
What are you talking about?
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
Freddy.
Cooling down.
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
This is stupid.
Oh God.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
Well... a shot at it.
Oh, stop showing off.
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
Really?
Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Okay -- fine.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
Exactly.  Here we go again.
Step aside.
You've got to go.
Why?
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
You have a stunt bottom?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Okay.
No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Oh.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
The truth is...
Rufus.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Miracles do happen.
He wouldn't say.
Christ, what is going on in there?
That's nice.
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Where's Bella?
Di Caprio.
Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
Topol.
So it could have been neither of them?
I suppose so.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
'No comment' means 'yes.'
I think you do, yes.
No -- did you?
No, no.  She doesn't.
What are the choices?
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Hi...
Which was?
Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Oh sure.  Of course.
Yes.
Why?
M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
Will you come with me, please.
Yes, ma'am.
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
No, it was irresponsible!
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
So long, kid.
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Ca-na-da...
Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
My feet hurt...
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
I refuse!
I'm the coach!
Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.
No!
I'm not running a charity ward...
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
Oh, do you do much fishing?
I'm afraid not.
Shhh!
No, 'fraid not...
You look pretty healthy to me.
Because I quit breathing.
What's going on?
Yeah!
How much ya wanna bet?
'Kay...
Okay. How you doing?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
What are they?
You an' me, Chief.
Hi.
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
I don't have any.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
You're a witness, Doc!
What's that?
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
Why?
Okaaaaayyyy.
Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
Thanks.
Non.  Please.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Who's this?
I'm in love with you.
Tell me.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Very funny.
Sure is.
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Is he gay?
So?...
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
No.  He's never asked me.
People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
Is that bad?...
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
So?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Polo.
Her brother.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
You sure you'll be okay?
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
No one's perfect, Kate.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
No.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
He missed me.
Good strategy.
That's really romantic.
I'm gonna take her home first.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
Then don't.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but
Thicker than water.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Boss loader!
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
I better see you get there.
Man, you were a mess!
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
I don't know.
No thanks... .
A dive? You mean, into the water?
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killednever mind how. Charley and I was put in a placethey called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
For not being any help?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
Edie...
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
No, I can't let you. I can't, you're
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
Who is he, Pop?
He wanted to see me again.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
I don't get it!
I'll find you a priest.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Nice fellows.
Take it easy.
What?
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
Yeah?
Really?
Looking for me?
Take it easy now, Terry.
Hit me again.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Go on a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Go on, beat it!
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Thanks for nothing, you bum.
One of these days.
I do not joke in my proposal.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
Whatever you do, don't do that.
...And I thought you loved me.
What can we do against them?
Maybe so.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
It would seem so, Master
For what!?!
You know better than that.
Yes, sir, Master.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
I said not as a rule.
Did you know that when you married him?
Who are you?
Oh.  Uh-huh.
You did work for Emil, right?
His assistant.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
You at least bring the gun?
Sure looks that way.
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
Two hours.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
You find out?
Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
All you gotta do is get in.
Jack --
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
Is that what you would've done?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
What do you want to bet?
No, I didn't know that.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Wait, I know him --okay?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Low class of people there, Snoop.
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Let's go outside and talk.
We're leaving.
Hey.  You learn from doing.
You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Why not?
It would be worth the risk.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
You know what I mean.
You think he's lying?
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
The next time I walk into a bank.
Meaning time came, I left.
That time?
And is Foley a part of this?
Why's that?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Gee, I wonder why not.
What?
Just a minute.
Thanks.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
No, he looks a lot...
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.
You wave back?
It's possible.  Why?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
No.  Course not.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
You liked that?
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
Sir, I --
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Fuck you.
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
Yeah.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
Do one thing for me, before you go.
...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold.
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
Fook ya!
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
That loudmouthed little bitch~
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
I'm not going.
Good.
Great, isn't it?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Come on, let's dance.
Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
I have to talk to you..
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
What the hell is that?
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I'll just set it right here.
Oh, God, Dion.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Okay.
What, why?
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
It must run in the family.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Is that one of your poems?
For everyone.
I can't do that.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
The hat business is in trouble.
Yes.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
I'm excused.
Mom!
Of course, dear. You're home now.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
I'm just happy to see you.
You have an incredible memory.
You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
I	know what a burrito is.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
Will you take of f your blouse?
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
What do they do up there?
Is he gonna be okay?
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Yeah...
He was dead. You know he was.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Because they deserve to, Walter.
Andy?
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
One hour!
Whatever.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
We're waiting...
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
What?
Thank you.
Correct.
Uh huh...
What happens?
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
I'm an excellent lawyer.
If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
Yes.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Thanks, Mom... Dad?
Objection.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
That's correct.
Aren't you?
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
My lettuce is wilting.
Going on... like...?
Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
Helloooo...
<u>What</u>?
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
We can't make it.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Possibly.
Only around humans.
Probably right.
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
I assume he licked it clean.
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
Just shut up, okay?
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
There is no "safe."
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Not staying in here another....
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Not if I'm the one.
So which one caught your eye?
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
What, it's broken?
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
The best. But we won't need them.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
Zira....
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
Let's find them all.
Him.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
long pause) You know it.
But I'm not prepared to die.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
What is this?
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Yes, Sir.
Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
But there's the doll, sir.
How the hell did he get away?
Says he can't walk.
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Over here!
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
And you, do you believe?
What you got there - beers?
I volunteered.
What are the heads?
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
Found it. Growing in a garden.
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
You don't know.
I'm supposing.
Why certainly, baby.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
I didn't say anything.
Do you think I don't?
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
He got in here how?
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
Quarter after one. Why?
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Is this the best you can do?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
Is it a crime?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
What does he see?
Very ridiculous.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
Leave that one lay.
So you're not a cop.
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
Could we discuss that some other time?
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Information.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
What?
You asked me where it all came from.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
Recently, then.
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
Open it and count it.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
I think so.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
Oh nothing.
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
I'm interested in who handled it.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
You ought to know why.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
What does it look like?
You already have the checks, darling.
It's kind of you to see me.
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Very good.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Of course.
Hello.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
Oh yes?
He's all right, the professor.
Might?
I know.  I'm sorry.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Far too long.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Hello.
Suez.  1956.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea.  Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years.  And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London.  I'm not telling you how to run your affairs.  I'm just saying ... I don't mind.  I'm giving you permission.
You're so famous now.
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
Oh no!
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
No.
Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
What's their program?
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
You do it... you first!
Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
No.
Caught my first tube this morning.
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
NOOO!!
Meaning you were expendable.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
What, Sergeant?
Mmmnnn...?
He knows our defenses.
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Please, we hardly know each other.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
You're making the right decision, sir.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
Sure.  For five bucks.
What motel you staying at?
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
For the whole night?
Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
You know how to drive a stick?
Do you plan everything?
Always.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Mmm, I could tell.
Of course.  How much?
Done.
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
Thank you <u>very much</u>.
You're forgiven.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
Ready to stomp sod?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
What if I lose it?
What if someone tries to steal it?
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
Right.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell?
Have you lost your mind?
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
They will serve salad.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Yeah.  Thanks.
I swear it will be done.
Should I be?
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
Nothing you can say will upset me.
There will never be a need.
I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
I have a little.
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
What?
-- wait, just wait --
-- murdered by pirates is good --
Someday, you may not mind so much.
I don't mind so much.
Okay.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Shall we track them both?
Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
And what is that?
I am not left-handed.
Get used to disappointment.
That would be inconceivable.
You know what a hurry we're in.
Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
It's nothing ... nothing.
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
But what if the play was a hit?
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
How's this? 
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Coney Island??
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
To failure!
No way out.  No way out.
Liebkind, no!
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Vat about it?
Yes.  We would!
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Nice girl.
Very nice girl.
All right.  All right.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
I'm not the police.
Look at the picture. Please.
I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
How early?
No.
What do you mean?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
What?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
I live there. Alone.
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Here?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
What do you know about it?
What thing could we be in together?
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Why can't I go out there with you?
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
Watch your tenses.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
Bates never denied Mary was here.
I could stand something regular.
Sam!
For what?
I can come down next week.
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
I'm thinking of it.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Thank you. Again.
I imagine so.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
Thank you, Norman.
Good night.
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Have you two had breakfast?
We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Satisfied with your cabin?
Fine.
Yes.
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
What--special autopsy?
Just before she died she came to--
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Indeed, he has often told me.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Who are you? What is your name?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Maybe you want my money, too.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Why didn't you notify the police?
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
I'd like to have a look.
I'm losing my blood!
A voice ...
That spoke to you?
The master ... is asleep!
Yes, the child ...
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
That's the way I feel about it.
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
The body of Joan Gale!
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Are you giving me this straight?
It happens that I'm the law.
I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Nope, I'm through!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
What!
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
No kiddin'?
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
That happens to be the truth.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
Oh, is that what caused it?
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
How much money have you got?
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
You're insane.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
You did miss --
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
Like now?
And glow happily ever after.
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
What'd you do, Rose?
You were pretty bad, huh?
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Well, some fiend might.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
But Rose...
Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
You're my sweetheart.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
No, he doesn't. Not really.
Let's go peep from the living room.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Yes, we know her.
Oh. Did you say something?
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
What did you forget?
I... I'll get the grits.
Well, good night.
There are more on the other side.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Yes, air.
What's the use, there ain't none.
Well. What kinda job is it?
You mean a farm?
Your baby?
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Galley what?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me.  Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.
She looks terrible, just awful.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts.
You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
You can stop it right now.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
It'll get better now.
I don't mind.
I was going to tell him.
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
Again.
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
How come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
Okay.  It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.
You going rogue on me?
I... I think I can... clarify...
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Billy!  Billy!
They're... around.
I can't do it, Ben.
You cannot escape your destiny.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
Yoda spoke of another.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Are you all right?
How are we doing?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Oh... great!
Leia!
I don't know.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Here's the terminal.
I'm trying!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
We shall double our efforts.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
I will not fight you, father.
Never-r-r!
Oh. Well, yes.
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
I've got something to say.
For you.
Dammit, Janet.
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
It's just a..a party Janet.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
Oh don't be so shy.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Makes you cry
No no no no.
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
You're too kind.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
...I suppose.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
I don't think you're a bum.
Morning after?
I sold them to you.
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Yes.
Sharp -- Real nice.
-- The legs.
No... I can't!
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
You didn't!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Owe you what?
Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
What?!
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
...Thanks.
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
How 'bout some Cokes?
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Paulie's sister.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Gonna try.
Sparrin'?
Did you hear what I said?
I like yella teeth.
What was I gonna say?
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Yeah, Kayo.
...Who'd ya fight?
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Ya got a good mind for dates.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
It don't matter.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
You serve martinis, doncha?
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
That's right, me.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
He made me laugh.
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
You tricked me, damn you!
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Romeo, come forth.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Meaning, to court'sy.
Right.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
A Plague o' both your houses.
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
And then...
That's why you were riding with him.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
It's been known to happen.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
From Interpol?
Not yet...
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
I'd stake my reputation.
He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
There's been a slight problem.
In here...
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
You'll die if you leave here.
It's done.
But first you have something to take care of?
Call it a reckoning of character.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Who's they?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
Know what?
Gregor's cell phone...
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
Clearly.
I know of him.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
It's my job.
Very ugly.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
You would have done that?
How could you have done that?
Something like that.
That's a good question.
And now...
Finish it!
What happened to it?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
Why didn't you kill him?
Doing well.  This is?
Why?  Are you kidding me?
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
What are you thinking?
Neither do I.
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
Then we're screwed.
No we're not.
And you're solid on that?
Rock solid.
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
And I'd take it out on him.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Did you say After Midnight?
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Well I just uh, you know...
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
So be here at three.
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Dwayne -
Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
Listen -
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
So...what's the good news?
You think he skipped town?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
How much is that?
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
I'm sorry.
I am a tourist.
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
What the hell is going on here?
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
Why LA?
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't want to hear this.
I don't need a turn!
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
Shhh, my head hurts.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
What's a Chinese heaven?
How was the sex?
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Who's Benjamin?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Yes.
Excuse me?
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
Just trying to make it look real.
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Yes, Master.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Shortcut?
You don't know what a shortcut is?
No.
Did you make the plate?!
Yeah, it's good.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
Who does not know War?  ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²
I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
The Feds?!
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
She's fine.
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I'm not running.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
It's hurting.
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Okay, we'll order out.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
And you defending her?
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Are you a reporter?
Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Originality is my speciality.
You'll answer my questions?
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
You're going to be very disappointed.
Done.
Highly suspect.
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
Bob will be very happy.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
I don't and I don't think you should...
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
A little longer for me.
So am I.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
Ya think?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
You don't love me, is that it?
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
It was my mother's.
I told you.  Nothing --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
What?
I should say something in this about magic.
Becky?
What?
Made for each other.
No, I'm not. 
I love the symphony.
Okay.
I know.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Yes.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
How did it happen?
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Mom, we already...
The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Who is this?
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
Why not?
Yeah.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Fair enough.
No.
Right, right.
I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
P.  Dad?
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
Whose show was this on?
How do you know?
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Like do you believe in heaven?
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
It's only ten o'clock.
I just called for a second.
Who is Annie?
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
It was all they had.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
What about camping?
You must be Jonah.
"An Affair To Remember." Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.  Before that it was called "Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."
Oh.
That's none of their affair.
Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Can be what?
Yes.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
Hunting.
What are you saying?
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
The what!
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
You've got to help around the house!
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
You should have helped her without being asked.
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?

You like that?
Who wouldn't?
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I'll see you tonight.
Leave me out of this.
This man sounds like a real catch.
I can't.
Fuck you.
I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
And you admire that?
Nothing.
What do you want from me, Colette?
It's me.
I'm kind of busy.
I can't tell you.
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
I don't want to leave you.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
Lead the way.
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Don't get carried away.
Can your man handle that?
10%.  That's ...
You aren't coming with me.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
When? When did you ever see me use?
I'm sorry?
Yeah.
You go, boy.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
Question is, what are you doing here?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
Bubba.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
What's he holding?
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
What do you mean?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
Now that's scary!
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
...alright, let me know when.
Casualties?
As a matter of fact, I am.
In West Fork?
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Not where I come from.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
You don't count.
Those guns are close.
The Germans do.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Good news?
You're kidding yourself.
Is it getting worse?
How about you shut up and take your position?
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Let's just find someplace.
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
Yes, sir.
But, sir...
Huh?
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
That's a mystery to me.
Get back to your positions!
Here they come.
Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
Lingerie.
What are we likely to run into?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
No, no he's not.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
For going to school?
Good for her.
Excellent.
I still am.
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Going out as friends.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Goodnight.
Now why can't I tell the story?
Dad, I'm sorry.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Sit down.
Bon voyage.
You think you know what this money is?
No, but you stole from them.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
Alright.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
So it's an honor?
You know what?
Basic.  Hmmm.
I'm doing alright.
Yeah?
Am I wrecking my car?
You're shaking.
Why didn't you tell me?
How can I look at you and say this?
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
I'm sorry.
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
What?
Okay.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
So what's up?
We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.
Hey.
You know Diane Court?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
Now you're back.
I'm talking to a clerk.
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
These people, my people, I want my people.
How do you do?
Yes.
Yes.
What other point is -
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
No.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
Where?
Stop it...
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Why aren't you there?
Why would you wanna do that?
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
Can we talk?
I don't think that's a good idea.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Youre all in this together?
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
Randy somebody.
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
And now, drum roll please...
Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
I never meant to imply...
Yeah, right.
Stay away from the cop.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
I dont know.
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
Easy black boy.
But she's standing right next to you.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Now.
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
More of a game really.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
Did you request this case?
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
What?  When?
What?
Sid I can see you!
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
And who is that?
Gale, your engine's still running.
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Bitch.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Who?
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Roman that's not the line.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
How do I know their voices are --
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Who the fuck is this?
You know it.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
And if you get it right -- you die.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
You sleep in THAT?
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
It's been a year since she died.
You have to move on, Sid.
Oh Sidney...
Yeah... I think so.
Uh-huh.
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Who is this?
Who are you trying to reach?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
No.
You never told me your name.
What do you think I said?
NOOO!
Come on. It'll be fun.
...please...
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
Afraid not.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
Then what are you doing here?
What kind of lead?
NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
I like it. It's... sexy.
Hold up a sec...
Shit.
...yeah...
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
How is everything?
We haven't located her Dad yet.
I owe you shit.
Do you still think he's innocent?
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Don't come any closer.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
They think it's school-related?
How do you gut someone?
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
And you believe it?
Come on, let's rock.
Oh, god...
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
I know what you're thinking, okay?  You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now.  You're retiring.  In six days you're all the way gone.
Where was the girl?
Okay...
It's going to be flawless.  People will barely be able to comprehend it.  It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
And, why is that?
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
It's close.
Drop it.
Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
And, if it's a threat.
Forced what?
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
I know.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
Oh, that's all.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
We'll tag along.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Him?
What?  Assessing fines?
We're focusing.
That is.
I'm fine.
It was him.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
I can't let you do this...
I can't do this now... please.
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
But Mose Harper said...
Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
Why don't you finish the job?
Captain Clayton...Captain!
Yes, sir...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
And maybe you lie...
I beg your pardon?
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Because she's my...my...
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
Never heard of him...
It's what I'm countin' on.
Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
Where?
Someone from the village.
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
You don't remember?
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
Thank you, Ned.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
You're a liar.
Most interesting.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
Good title.
So what do we do?
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
it will be all right, madam.
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
God be praised!  Locked?
How will it?
I have. And chinks to show for it.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
I will.
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
Oh, not for the world!
Even your play.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
I must. I must
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
You flatter, my lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
Where did you learn how to do that?
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
She loves me, Thomas!
And her voice? Like lark song?
She sings too?
What of her bosom?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
But what of Lord Wessex?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
Juliet?
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
Take his legs.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Nothing.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
Yeah?
But there's no --
I don't know.
What?
What?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
You see, they don't really know me.
David?
No.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
And now you tell me.
David?
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
Oh, good.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
What about?
Burglary?
There are only two other people in the flat.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
That's what it cost, David.
In this firm.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
But they sneer, don't they?
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
I'd be delighted.
Chicken salad, Devra!
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
What do you expect me to do about it?
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
I don't want to place you in any position --
Yes.
What about?
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I know.
She's a friend of Jill's.
Hello.
... yeah.
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
... just, you could look very heavy...
That you're just like your mother.
I went to school with her husband.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
You going to tell him?
Do you? You still see him?
I know... you don't know, I know.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
Nothing.
-- mmm --
-- yes, you --
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
I don't know... Jackie?
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
I'm busy, man.
-- Otis?
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
I have to see you.
Now, George --
I am?
Yeah.
Do you really mean that?
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Of course I like children.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Go where?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
What is.
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
Yes.
I'd like you to leave now.
Baby, don't do this --
Yes, yes, I did.
You need a cut.
Thank you.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
Well... who are those guys?
Sit down.
Did they have something against me?
Wasn't sure it was you.
No.
Yeah.
Okay.
Somebody's mother.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
That's not very logical, Lester.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
You're still jealous.
See you later.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
So what's your point?
-- No. No really.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
How much?
Jackie --
It's been so long I don't how long?
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
Is he an enemy?
What does he do? Is he an actor?
He's a hairdresser.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
-- oh I don't know --
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
Do you have something against traveling?
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Where to, Les?
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
Come here for a minute, first.
Okay.
I can't.  I have too much to do.
I guess so.
What?
No, Dad.
Tony.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
Yeah.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
No.
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Is Tony one of your animals?
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
All right, sir.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
I hope it's nothing serious.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
No, nothing at all.
Yes.
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
Jack...
Of course you are.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stop swinging the bat.
Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!
Stop swinging the bat.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Well, that sounds fine to me.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Oh!
Went shopping. Why?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Rats...
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
You know, I just might!
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
Today was the deadline, Vince.
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
Oh my! 
HE'S SO FINE.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
Because we're
Enough jabber.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
Wet behind the ears.
What?  What time is it?
I... I brought you something.
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Experience!
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Very well.
Your cigarette -- out.
And all those like you.
Check your driver's license.
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Would you like that?
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
No food.  Not until sundown.
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Out of the question.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
You saved my life.
So I don't shop.
Who are you guys?
We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
We didn't tell you what?
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
I lied.
Find 'em!
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
... Brom Bones...
You will stay at her side?
Wallowing in sin and lust...
He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
A fine idea.
Believe?
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
Father said witches live there.
What was she doing?
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
You are funny.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
No, but... why do you ask that?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
Come with me.
What would you have me believe?
I... I can't do this.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
No.  She has gone out.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
I didn't see none.
You are from the Hollow?
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
Father saw you die.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.
Yeah.
What?
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
Sarcastic right?  You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
I thought I told you to keep out!
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do.  Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!
Yeah.
How come?
Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time. If you ever want to come by and play. We ain't no good either. Well, I'll see you later.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Why did he do that, reckon.
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Yeah.
It was alive?
Yeah.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Yes sir.
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
All right then.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
What's that you say?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Did you knock on the door yet?
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
Do you smell shit?
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Yes sir.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Actually, I'm his father.
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
I'd love to.
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
It's yours?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
A photographer ...
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
But they're all the same.
How old, kid?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Hi, Auggie.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Yes, I suppose I do.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Where to?
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Why don't you open it and find out?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
And these?
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
And his parents?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Aren't you going to say anything?
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
What are you talking about?
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
Is your father an artist?
What time is it?
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
Thanks. 
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
No way.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Here, catch.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Yeah, I picked it up.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
No wonder he was angry.
I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
Yes, please.
Carl Heine's type.
None.
A thousand.
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
You're implying th...
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
Those aren't the facts that matter.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
Twelve.
Like you couldn't believe.
Yes.
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
I was checking the cables.
Maybe.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
And her farmhouse...?
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Is it possible?
<u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
You're welcome.
The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby.  I ride side-saddle.'
We're not?
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
You better come help me.
Down, Daphne!
You tore it again!
We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
Blow where?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
Daphne, you're bothering us.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
We're not on the pier yet -
I'll say.
I'm not that sick.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
I may spill something.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
What for?
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare.  Something I ate.  I'm not at all well.  See?  Hot water bottle.
I am Cinderella the Second.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
It doesn't matter.
I forgive you.
Well - nobody's perfect.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
Have you ever been with a male band?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
That so?
Yeah.
Why not?
So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
What makes you so sure?
My fault.
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
- riding to hounds -
Tonight?
Oh?
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
I don't mind if I do.
It's the crews' night off.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Have you ever tried American girls?
Thanks just the same.
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
From a rich millionaire.
Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
PLEASE!
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Okay, Charlie.
Except its Scotch.
Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havent made up since.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Yeah.
And Kat was fully clothed.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
So, whats your point?
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
Both.
What does your gut say?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
A weekend?
A wedding.
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnt be violated.
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
So whats with the nickname?
Hi.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Its complicated, Dad.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
Sometime, but not like this.
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
What's his name?
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
What do that mean?
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Guess I can't just lay here, then.
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
When's that?
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
David, come back here!
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
I'll walk...
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
I'm used to it.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
Little chilly.
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
What... are you?
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
And she's getting worse...
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Yes, hon?
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
It's... It's not good children.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Uhh... Bacon.
America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children.
Kay.
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
I thought you had something planned.
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
But I-
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Oh yeah!
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
I know, Terrance. I know.
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
You don't care.
That's nice, Stan.
Excuse me?
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
I'm sure I will.
I did nothing to the monitors.
Look answer my question!
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!  I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
I don't know.
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Yeah?
Helllp!
The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
I can't!
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Try not to think about it.
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Where's Taylor?
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
I'm from Akron.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
That game was before you was born.
My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
You're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
I'm getting to like it here.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
He says that to all his wives.
What about bowling?
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Junior.
What ever happened to just bowling?
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
He's my father, Millie.
He's no father to you.
Whips...orange whips.
Coming right up.
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
What do you want with my dad?
The mental hospital.
Whoa.
No, I'm fascinated.
Why were you suspended?
What's plan B?
Zip.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
Did you - kill him?
I feel sick.
Can I come with you?
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
What about plan C?
Fuck plan C!
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Who identified the body?
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
Thirty yards.
Norman, don't do it!
Pull it, damn it!
Storm?  What storm?
Then why am I here?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
Wait a second --
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
In the ship, sir.
They've left, keep watching!
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Ted seems to have some ideas.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
What is it?
To what?
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
What do you mean -- not normal?
And you didn't tell anyone?
Beth.
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Where did you get this?
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
Don't do this.
Don't bother me, Norman.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Fixing it.
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
Valdomet.
Tarazine?
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
How do you spell it?
It's a soporific.
Beth --
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Are you manifesting them?
Someone did.
I never went in that sphere.
Top shelf, is it?
Beth --
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
For whoever's in that thing.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Another attack?
What?
Look, would you --
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
It's like...
Norman, where are you?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
But why would she -- ?
How do we decode it?
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Her legs are in the way.
I'm trying.  There.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
Captain who?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Still, make a note I recognized that.
I don't see anything.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
Not bad.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
What do you mean?
They use the Bogan Force.
All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
Are you safe?
Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
What an honor...
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
You and me, huh ?
Zander, please... Let's go !
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
Is it true ?
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
Zander, no...!
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
I'll meet you outside.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
Yes, ma'am.
Too bad for her if she's not around.
How come we never got together ?
Sure.
Flip six, three hole.
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
I wouldn't mind.
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
I'm gonna save Carmen.
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
<U>Answer</U>!
We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Mr Decker....
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
Decker....!
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Twelve seconds...!
Thrusters ahead, one third.
And whatever you sensed out here....
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
To you, sir?
Dock signals clear, Captain.
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
Tractor beam remains constant...
Go you Huskies?
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
I beg your pardon?
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
It's...
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
No, no, I see...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
I <u>can</u>?
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
Me?
I thought you had Play Practice.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Would you go in...
Oh, God...
You going to ask me in?
...because if you don't, they die...
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
I hurt you?
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Gosh, you look nice.
Now you're talking...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
If I go to jail...?
Drama Group?
Go you Huskies...
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
We did...?
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
Fifteen hands.
She wasn't in the...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
She's a...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
<u>Bobby</u>...
Everybody needs a hob...
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
Mr. Bailey.
I think he's moved...
That's my...
Oh.
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
I'll put the, in your r...
-- she's got 'religion.'
You said <u>three</u>...?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
This young woman.
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
You should.
What?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
Who's White...?
He saw the girl in the car...
I know the feeling.
I grew up on your mov...
I know you do.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
I...
I didn't say anything to them.
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
I don't got the money.
We don't have the money.
There's no witnesses...
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
...it is?
Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
I live.  In the same country.
Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
Mom?  What's wrong?
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
See, I...
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
Great.  Big ears, too?
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
Ice cold water.
That's my girl...
And many meatballs.
You have the WORST flu since...
How do you know?
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
You dying.
But you can still see him.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Because you don't really seem here.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Jackie, she was five minutes late --
Easy enough.
You're WHERE?
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
We don't have any coffee.
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
I was in there in him.
You got to hell!
Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Nobody likes a snoop.
We can't live like that.
And you said...
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
And her...?
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
That's not wh...
Oh please.
You ride with Annabelle...
I have their past.
We have to talk.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Well, they will be.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
He isn't.
There are some rumors...
Like what?
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Nice to have you here.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
No.
My Jesus
But still, you can't be sure.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
Nothing, I guess
We're not ready!
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Ready for tomorrow?
I can read it to you.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
Gee, you're home early!
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Thank you for being honest.
...gger.
Again!
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Oh, fine. How are you?
That's too bad.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Oh, I don't remember that...
Hunh.
Eight, six, and four.
Is it loaded?
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
Prnceton.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Y-yes--
Listen man, I don't need this shit--
What happened!
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
Shut up!
She's still alive.
Good.
She's as good as gone...
What do you mean?
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Moffo!
Yes, of course.
I'll hold this, if you don't mind.  You can have it back when you leave.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Didn't they tell you?
Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
What kind of trouble?
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
And if that were true?
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
How much soda, sir.
Just a squirt.
I see.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
They're coming in now.
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Maybe it's an exercise.
What?
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
First safety.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Recall what mistake?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Are you sure?
But I get a red light.
Have you tried the emergency system?
Let me check.
There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, I guess.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
What's it about?
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
Your a nurse?
Any gunshot victims?
Right now?
Yeah.
Now?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Yeah.
The dude wants it.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
I'd get bored.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Ah!
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Okay.
Sure.
No, I mean, no one.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Y- s-sure it did.
Erica is in the van back there.
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Play it! Come on!
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
I will.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Well, play it, man.
Please.
Mm.
Oh, yeah?
Mm.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
You cut off your little finger?
It's a mistake to think that.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
He's drunk.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Who were you talking to?
Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
What'd you do?
You don't know?
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
I don't know.
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
About things that are important to me.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
But do you stand for anything?
Yes, I stand for -
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Tim!
Sooze.
What feelings?
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
No, no.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No. No, no, no.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Mm.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Well, what about us?
Just go.
Good, man.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah, good.
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Well, not exactly.
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
New York, huh?
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
Would I get paid?
Yeah.
Mine too.
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
If...
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
I think I gotta go.
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
It's none of my business?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
The fuck not?
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Positive.
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Huh?  Oh Jesus...
Let me explain something...
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Don't use big bills!
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
My best friend got pregnant.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
That was the general idea.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
I've been hoping to run into you.
I had a teacher like that once.
As for instance?
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
You did?
I tell you this is half sold.
Well, for heaven's sake!
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
So do I.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
Who's who?
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
Why?
Who else ?
This is fascinating.
I don't know.
What month?
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
Where do you live?
I'll take care of that.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
What's that?
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
You're a darling.
Where are your...?
All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
Thank you, darling.
Good.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Yes, I am, Norma.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
Wanted what?
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Right with you.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Frankly, no.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Yes.  Madame.
Am I? Still?
Western Europe.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
Tell me where I can find her.
You don't like me? You hate me?
Well...I guess one is all right.
Like turning off a light.
I sort of like what you said.
She'll forget about us eventually.
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
You vicious--
I don't know. You seem afraid.
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
You're supposed to guess.
I allowed it to escape the City.
As brave as my father. As wise.
You're not...an orphan are you?
She's a beast.
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
I have to talk to you.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Not yet.
For what?
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
That's home.
Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Mr. Roebush?
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
No, thanks.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Can I help?
Mom and I do this all the time.
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Yeah.
What kind?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
First paycheck?
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Say who?
Columbia.
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Me? How?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
What are you talking about, fella?
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
Fair's fair.
For what?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Can you do that?
We gonna crash?
No...I just have a little stop to make.
It was hot!
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
Whoopee.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Where's the light switch?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Today coffee----
TOMORROW THE OIL!
Be my guest.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
How could you win a crazy bet like --
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
You do?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
You'll have to pack quickly.
Genius!  --  Lex.
I'll be alright.
I think he said a "curl."
Now This I want to hear.
Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.
He ran in fear from us . . .
Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
And I will lead.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
Clark . . . wait!
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
. . . And  very naïve!
Superman gets mail here?
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
But why the hair?
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
You're just an experiment, freako!
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Thank you.
It was hot, yes.
Lois isn't here?
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Not...gray.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
No thanks.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
You're on.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
We just take it?
Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
I'm wearing it.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
What's your name, boy?
He sure as heck does that.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
How good it felt -
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
How old are you?
Pink.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
Otis...
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
Maybe I should get help.
Alison Jones.
And what does he do again?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
That's okay.
What happened?
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Alison.
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
Billy, please.  The children.
C'mon, you know that won't...
We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards.  We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad.  The rescue squad.  Because they didn't act fast enough.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Billy, that's too early.
When the game's over, I guess.
That's because he misses you.
It's natural.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Why?
Why did you do that, Billy?
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
For rabbits?
No.  I saw it on his face.
Berries.
What do you mean?
The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
He knows that?  Billy?
Hi, Dolores.
I didn't say that.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
No.  A little sugar though.
Isn't it a lovely day?
And winter?
It's interesting.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Who's Mr. Stephens?
No.  What's this lawyer business?
When?
People who will help our cause.
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
What for?
Is there shrimp on it?
You've been retained?
Yes.
No.
You are?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
No.
You mean it?
Nothing.
The ramp?
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Hitler!
Is "he" inside?
But of course...
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
I guess you're right, but -
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
You told him that?
No, I wouldn't...
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
I said Sidney!...
J.J., Steve isn't...
I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
I didn't say that, J.J.
I don't?
When?
And who's feet is she on now?
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
- He's got them on him.
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
And where was his wife?
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
That's no way to talk...
It is a favor, isn't it?
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Did you now?  On which bounce?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
I would.
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
No.
Go!  I'll finish here.
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
No.
Please continue...
Our duty is to help Furtwängler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
Eating is eating... and...
I'm very sorry.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
I guess it's possible.
Yes.
What's that mean?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
You do shorthand and typing?
Your mother, too.
And your father was executed.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
Of course.
What is this, Emmi?
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Then you are wrong.
Von der Null?
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Who's conducting?
Do you know what's in this archive?
How could I know what's in the archive?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
Show you?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
So. You wanted to see me.
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
One of your people told me.
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwängler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?

The what?
Come here.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
You volunteered?
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
Someone?
A girl.  You know.
Oh, Kyle.
The year 2027?
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Of course.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
Now, look...
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
Don't just stand there, get help!
This can't be real...
Alright... okay...
You pull me up.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
I thought...
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
Wha... ?
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
That's a lie...
Who the fuck cares?
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
That's not true...
No...
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Why would you say that?
I know...
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
Yes.
And, they didn't take that watch?
I hope.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
What's all this for?
Oh... it's a game.
What kind of vacation?
Humor me with specifics.
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
It's all down to this...
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Is there a room key?
No, you didn't...
Have a nice day.
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
Where's my brother?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Look, where is he?!
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
What?
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
Nothing else?
It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
Sam...  Thank you.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
I've read your tests.
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
But there's a sad catch to the story.
What happened after you smelled it?
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
Nell, what do we do?
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
Why would we --
What did it cost?
It's all I could afford.
That depends.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
No.
Yes.  I've missed it.
No.  The world has missed you.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Then let's go get you one.
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
It's not a compliment.
As soon as you get dressed.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
I sure hope so.
Where do we go?
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
No reason.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
And that's where you met Jenny.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Has he?
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
First in, first out, that's me.
Not much -- you?
Well, those are the breaks.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Not embarrassed.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
Who remembers.
I don't believe it.
You ever been to London?
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
What am I doing?
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
Could do, yeah.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
You bet.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Sure you do.
Susan.
Who's looking for you?
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
Yes, Ann?
Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards...
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
Just see him, as a favor to me.
Ah... it's nothing.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Birdy--
Ah.
Well? How'd she do?
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Sure.
Right! Strictly business.
That'll be fine.
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
How much to they want, Dave?
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Please, Ed.
...Huh?
I, uh...
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure.
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
I knew we'd pay for it.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
No thanks.
He a good man?
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Jesus...
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
The hell with it, Eddie!
Huh? No.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
Not an owner.
Homicide.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Calm down.  I found it!
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
What's left of it.
Mind if I have a look?
Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man.  Been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  Not a likely suspect.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
I wouldn't be so sure.
Yes.
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Big as a house.
Not that big.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
So what?
Okay.
You were going to be married.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
Would you mind showing it to me?
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
The answer's right in front of us.
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
It's the busy season.
I thought you were in a hurry.
What's to see?
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
Gee, that's great.
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
I won't be here Sunday.
What?!
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
You blaming me for the traffic?
I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
Well, we're FBI agents.
You're not FBI agents.
Yup.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
They took her --
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Brought on by what?
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
Before the bomb went off?
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
How's that?
Scully, I found the bomb.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
I was until about an hour ago.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
On whose orders?
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have his number.
Thank you.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
That's my girl.
He needs to be turned over.
I don't need them anymore...
I know.
What then?
Peter, okay?
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
Evil.
Like hell "wait."
Delano?
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
No.
You're looking well.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Now.
I don't have to.
Ja, ja, ja.
Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
Sit down.
Oh, yes, yes.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Dr. Winkel.
Where is she?
What are you going to do?
Have you seen Calloway?
I saw him today.
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
Yes.
They're Harry's.
There's nothing in them.
And my passport?
I don't want it.
You a friend of Lime's?
Been here long?
No, sorry.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
Bring him in.
I'm not asking you to.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
No, I don't know...
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
It's good to see you, Holly.
I told the police.
You can get somebody else...
Do you expect me to give myself up?
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
In great pain?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
Yes.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Where are you staying?
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
So how many miles do you think it is?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
But he has been there, off course.
No.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Incredible.
Exactly.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
Where did you lose it?
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
The Nazis did everything the führer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Yes.
Fire...
Why the fuck not?
I don't care about money.
You will.
Then how come you're talking to me?
I stole it. From a synagogue.
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
It looks a little like a swastika.
V'asitem...
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
It's the truth....
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
What??!?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Notice? Like what...?
I don't know. Is that right?
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Give me a reason not to.
No.
How do you reconcile the two?
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
To hear them read Torah.
I can't say that.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
<i>New York Times</i>...?
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Where?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
Shut up...
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
"Do chickens give milk?"
Obviously.
Fund-raising??
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
He seems to have won it.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Hello!
Yes.
No.
No.
Congratulations, Enzo.
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
How many are, down there?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
Fine!
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
What?
Your mother?
... For the mermaids.
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
You say that because you have the title!
... I was right about what?
I can't.
We saw each other a little while ago.
... Okay.  I'll try.
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
I'm still here.
Then, tell me a story.
It's me again.
Absolutely positive.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
You go back, I'll walk.
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
I saw how it has to be.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
They're going to send detectives.
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
But... how is he going to breathe?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
Please, call me Mordechai.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
Worse.
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
Let's get in your truck.
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
All men are fools. They like to make a big show - shout and hunt --
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too  when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret  a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
Why?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
Charlie likes his leopard.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
It's better you don't know.
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
They do, but -- there are no lights out there - they'll just be shadows -
Why?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
Now look what you've done.
And not a sign of the leopard?
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
I got into a little crap game.
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
No. Thank you. Ill be fine...
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
I dont know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
What... What are you talking about?
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
How... When did you...
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Leon hung himself.
You dont say.
...Were turning in circles.
Something like that.
Where is that?
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
01766 770 471. Let me check it for you, sir.
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
I dont smoke. If you could get to the point...
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
Shell be alright. Shes tough...
So, what are you looking for?
What...?
Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!
Where is he?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Oh. This is... Wed arranged to meet tonight and Im due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My fingers on the trigger, you hear!
Should I be?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
Thats what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnt take on another child, that hed get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasnt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think hes back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leons. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Cinq cents.
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
So why didnt he?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
So... pretend it's not a game.
10,000 gold crowns.
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Now?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
No...
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
No, I... I held it up to...
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
We want her burned as a witch!
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
Who are you?
Not unless you hear my confession.
Yes.
Buying her?
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
Does he have hair?
Good.  Where are the English?
He's on the other side of the river.
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Yes.  We can pray.
Reinforcements?  Where??
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
It's not possible...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
If you kill him, you kill me!
Playing...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
What do you mean, they won't come?
Yes... lots of things!
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, I...
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Whose were they?
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Him?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
Oh, yes. I remember.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
Wladek, please.
Come in! come in!
I'll be fine.
What's happened?
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Funny time to say this.
wish I knew you better.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Yes, please.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
They were taking you away.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
Can you help? I've no money...
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
I was listening, Kitten.
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
Where are we going?
Where do you live?
Szpilman.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
Like it were a piano?
No, it was a table.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
On your property?
What for?
No.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
They are washed.
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
He chopped it off
She says, throw the piano overboard.
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
All right if I look around your lobby?
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
What do we do?
Here.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Don't worry about it, pal.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Good lad.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
You know anything about him?
Why?
Neither are we.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
He'll show.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous.  You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
I also gotta win.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
Where's June today?
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
Maybe a couple million.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
I am after this race.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
We'll see you before you go.
Why not?
Another young man.
Go!
Now do you believe me!
Why don't you try him again?
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
He's been dead for three months.
You see how much we have to say.
If you think it'll be all right.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Not at all.
Gilbert!
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
This is enough for me.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Tell 'em.
Where were you?
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
You've said that for weeks.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
I can't! I haven't got it!
But suppose some business comes up...
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
What'll I do if something comes up?
S'long.
want to talk to you about something very important.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
They'll want more than your word for that.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
I had him out this morning.
Rye.
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
Maybe a drink would help you.
No thanks.
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
Someone get a doctor.
I'll get some towels. 
Yeah.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Sit down!
What's the matter with you?
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
What are you going to do?
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Sure I will.
I did find him!
He was down in the shop.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
No.  Nobody but you.
Why not?
What are you going to do?
Got a nice evening dress?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Maybe she has.
Home!
Home?
Y-yes.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
For climbing.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
What about the gold?
You said he was a deserter.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
We thought--
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
Roger that.
Oh, that's fun.
You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
You can't tell anybody about this.
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
I got that...sir.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
What?
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
Makes two of us.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
With what?  Against how many?
You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
What?
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
You want to say some words?
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Too low.
No, Tetanty.
What?
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
Incredible!
You're in violation.
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
...and you're not lost now?
That way.
What?
Maternity ward, huhh!
No?
No......  She's dead THX........
Look more closely.
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
No thanks, Bev.
What do you mean?
We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
Only once, at Redstone.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Why do you do it?
Where you guys at?
I don't know.
Right.
We work fast enough for you?
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
Shut up!  Who is this?
But sir--
Maybe she knows your old man.
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
Nothing so far.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
It's about this.
What?
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Report on the case so far.
Yes, sir.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Well, have you found it?
Very well, Jacques.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
No.
Constantinople?
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
Nice suit.
Like it?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
Yes, Baron.
Just a second.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
But not now.
Very well, m'sieu.
I know it!
Just call me Gaston.
Just as you say, Doctor.
The tennis player?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
No--proud. Very proud!
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Thank you.
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
What time is your rendezvous?
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
I remember.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
Peaches and cream.
No. What is it? Tell me.
What?
Yes!
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Ye-es?
How do you like my dress?
Marvelous.
Yes, I would!
Like that!
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Giron...!
Yes, Madame Colet?
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
Naturally not!
He started it.
Then why did you do it?
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
So do I.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
You wanted to see the propellers?
What do I tell your mother?
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Good. Settled then.
Well I can.
No, but we're making excellent time.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
I've got you. I won't let go.
Well, here you are.
You're welcome. Rose.
So don't marry him.
I see you.
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
Jack, I --
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
He couldn't have.
I promise.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Sure!
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
What did you want a gun for?
Get moving--
Good-by.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Very--your mother?
But I'll have cocktails with you.
I'll be there--Good-by.
You said it! How about a little action?
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
You can live that down, can't you?
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Not a chance.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Partners, ain't we?
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
<U>Me</U>!
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
It's a pleasure.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Thanks. That makes us square.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Sure.
No. <U>Knots</U>!
Yes--Me--in person!
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
Everything O.K.?
Just what the doctor ordered.
No--not much--excepting-- 
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
You don't shoot squirrels.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
Thanks to me.
You leave the kid alone.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Let me look at it.
Ain't got time.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
You whore!  You filthy whore!
Beauty, ain't he?
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Good.  That's real good.
Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
But Doc-
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
All right.  Then what?
I don't.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Good God, you're really-
I know.  Me neither.
So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
Fun though, wasn't it?
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
Where do you get these questions?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
I read this book, book on Spiritualism...
What're you talkin' about?
I know.  And nobody can make him.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Jack...
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
So to speak.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
And still not a thing to watch.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
- We all want what we can't have?
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Political considerations?
How is old Q?
Hey - the world is my office.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Have we met?
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
What?
Are you listening to me?
If not?
We blast through.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
Remind me.
No.
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Since when?
What did your wife get her?
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Maybe I can get down there next week.
What is it, noontime?
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
It is just a regular card.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Now how far would further out be?
I'm not here to argue, sir.
Go back to sleep.
Hush.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
Hattie is a different person now.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
My mother passed on years ago.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Whadda ya think?
Oh, yeah!
You can bring ONE toy...
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
That's why.  Sid.
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
But why would Andy want me?
What?!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
I got dibs on his hat!
Did I get my package in the mail?
Oh no, Hannah!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Will you quit moving around?!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
Uh-oh.
No, Slink --
There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
Is that all?
I've got a present for you...
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Listen to me carefully.  First of all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow.  So here you're wasting your time.  Are you with me?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
That's frustrating.
Me, too.
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
Not yet.
What do you think?
Helena --
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
You do?  What else you do?
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
I feel good.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
Especially Tiger Woods.  ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
We're playing!
Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government.
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
Noriega is a criminal.
Any way we can do it better?
Right.  But, that's not the biggest problem.  One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else.  It doesn't smell like coke.  It doesn't look like coke.  And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test.  It could be anything.  Maybe it's already happening.  I mean, how would we know?
What?
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
Christ.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
What?
Eh-
Jesus.
And don't make any noise.
Yes.
Too young for what?
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
Unless you get caught.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Now?
Right.
Director?
Lewis Gilbert.
OK, so who was it, then?
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Despite the Academy award?
Yeah.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
Your favourite dish.
Your usual table, sir?
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
The ship....
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's` safe with me. I'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.
I don't have a clue.
A Federation starship.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Have the Klingons responded?
Understood. Kirk out.
The power was within you.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Transporter room. Status.
The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please.
Jim.
Yes, Captain.
Yes.
Fascinating.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
I have a half brother.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
The ship needs its Captain.



I hide no pain.
I know you better than that.
Do you?
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Hi, Flynn.
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
I want to go to his place.
For being on to Dillinger.
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
They'll start to soon enough.
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
For sure...
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
What do you want with the Pentagon?
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
What's wrong with that area?
Why? What are you going to do?
Whew. You never were much for small talk.  She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
Where are you off to young lady?
Yeah, Dad.
Okay, Dad.
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Fourteen, Harry.
No way.  Not Dana.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
What are you talking about?
The purse is still at the house.
Sorry.
I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
Okay.
What did you tell him?
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
What about Juno?
Go ahead.
No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
Nope.
Oh, hush up.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Is that your real name? Really?
How 'bout me what?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
What are your turn-ons?
You didn't do nothing.
A real live pimp?
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
You don't know him -
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
That rhymes.
Naw naw!
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
If I thought I could get away with it -
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Ask him if he got the letter.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
Where?
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
Want an animal cracker?
He trusts you?
Get on your knees.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
I bullshitted him.
You were a cop.
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
I give up. Who are you?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
No.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
What about him?
Could we try it now?
But a fuckin' baggie.
Or a supporting actor -
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
He saw the wire.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
He knows something's up.
Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
Yes.
Do you know where we can find him?
Where's that?
Donowitz, he said.
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
What are you going to do with us?
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
Change what?
No, 1995 is the past.
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.
Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
Jeffrey Mason?
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
Shot!  Who shot you?
That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
It was?  I didn't...know.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
...I had a dream about...something like that.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
Might be tight.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
More or less.
Same back at you.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
How much.
One way, or round trip?
So?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
Come back when the sun comes up.
Let me have a Beck's.
Genuine Draft?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
John--
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
May I carry your package, Grace?
What happened to your hand?
No trouble at all, really.
That's all right.  I got it.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Those are white words, not ours.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
You love him?
No.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Is it pretty?
You live pretty good.
Lied?  What do you mean?
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
I could if I had Jake's money.
What was I supposed to do?
What?
Just drive.
Can you climb back up.
The trunk.  It's locked.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
I'm a solid man.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
Would you kill her?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
Make it twenty.
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
You think that's a lot of money?
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
No.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
You came to take my wife from me?
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Give it to me!
A hundred-forty-five really.
Jesus!
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Christ no!
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Hell no!
That a fact?
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
What?
...And everything is nothing too.
All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians . You gotta watch where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Oh, shit!
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
You've got to be--
I'm a solid man.
An overheated car.
I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I'm not rambling.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
I need thirteen.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
It's the truth, Jake.
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
For what?
Harlin around?
Yep.
Time.
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
Hundred-fifty.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
You got the money?
You're welcome, Grace.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
What?
Lift me down.
You know what I want.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Don't feel like nothing.
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
But I thought --
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
You could give me my gun back.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
Sure, I'll try.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
How old is Jeb?
What does that mean?
I know.
He's asleep.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
You use your sleeve.
What was that?
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
What was your idea Elijah?
I don't know what you're asking?
Yes he is.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
I'll help you.
There's nothing to do.
No Jeremy.
I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
Forget why. Do you want it or not?
Where is it?
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS!
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
He said...
Ah, I see.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
He give 'em names?
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Three days? I must be.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Oh.
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
You could run off them two cowboys.
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
What?
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
N-no, sir?
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
About what?
Jesus!
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
You don't recollect!
He got the boy's horse.
H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
Yeah.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Well, she...
Yeah.
He hit you?
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Best we move that pig.
Three.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
More.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Plenty of times.
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
What was the money for?
Who ?
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
A glass of water would be nice.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
County. I was in for fraud.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
Never heard of him.
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
You know damn well, dead-man.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Did they charge him with anything?
Two hours, tops.
Which is shit.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
I'm not a rat.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
The D.A. gave me immunity.
And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
Wait a minute.
But Keaton...
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
This is all bullshit.
Why lie about everything else, then?
You're joking.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
Ah.  How did they treat you?
As far as we know, nothing.
... tell me about this case.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.
What is the truth?
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth.  He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye.  You meet him at the hospital.'
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
When she...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Yes.
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
No.
I know of him.
Yes.
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
We just ...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
...I made a reservation at...
Yes...I...yes.
I.  Yes.  It is.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
You're going to settle out of court?
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Listen to me, fella...
Mr. Concannon...?
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
Let me talk to Mickey.
Pardon?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
No, no, I'm just...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Uh ...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Admittance form is wrong.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
They still have to take it to a jury.
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
I don't know.
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
Yes.
She did?
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
Yes.
What did she say?
Huh.  And why is that?
Yes.
The Big Boy did...?
Okay.  Now, so he's in jail.  He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake.  As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.   P.S.  He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink  and mopes around three and a half years.   You like that story?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
From whom?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
It's not my line.
Nothing.
And when she goes to those places...
She... went into the Bay.
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Judy Barton.
I told you! Right here!
Just dinner.
An hour?
Mmm.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Is that the best you can do?
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Oh, yeah. There.
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Some money.
You like it, too.
What?
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Where?
How do you know?
What else?
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
I'm here, I've got you...
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Let me go! Let me go!!
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, yes!
Carlotta Valdes?
How long has she had the room?
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Would you please go and look?
I know. Everybody tells me.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Three whole weeks.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Oh... this and that.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
By whom?
Can we have it by tonight?
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
What?
What's that?
Multiple reasons.
You're not a team player.
You fucking bastard!
What are you doing?
Why?  Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
Why?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
We can't do this.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Who? What are you talking about?
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
They're singing.
Later.
Don't ever stare him down.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Doing the bachelor party thing?
What is her disposition?
I said, what have we done?
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
What does that mean?
I'm serious.
You need help.
True.
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
You said nobody would miss her.
Goosed!
Government cutbacks.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
I think so.
Sent it.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
What?
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
He's a moron.
He's quiet.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
I'm working on it.
Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.
Okay. Okay.
What?
It's too late.
What money?
The only proof is those bodies.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
I love you dad.
What does that mean?
I just want her to be happy.
I don't hear it.
Yup.
My God...
Okay great. What will that be?
Okay boys, smile!
Drum banging real times.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?
Are there many windows?
Then it's a respectable house.
You have no feelings toward ...
Who is she?
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
What's the matter?
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
But why? Why?
Nothing.
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
Leave him alone.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
Stop this!
Yes!
All right, Mother.
From the terrace.
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
What about them?
Do me a favor  keep sending them.
If you can catch him.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Only because I got pulled out early.
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
Of course you are.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
I am impressed.
But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
What does that mean?
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
You know I am.
I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
Part of him is.
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Lindenmeyer?
Duck!
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
What are you talking about?
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
What are you saying...
It's the White House.
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
...where?
Who's got the story? 
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
And you?
It's going to be fine.  It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
...you want us to go to War...
<u>Who</u>?
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
<u>Yes</u>:  she is saying this in Albanian, <u>but</u> she's doing it not to be uh...  But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional...
<u>So</u> forth...
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
...how ya feeling, boy?
Out in Oklahoma.
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
Why do people go to war?
I have.
Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours. 
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
"Freedom."
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
It's a teaser, absolutely right,
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
...<u>isn't</u> it?  Hey, what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your <u>life</u>, ruin'd your <u>Culture</u>, but...
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
A proud tradition.
Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.  You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ...  He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...  Gemme the Pentagon.  List of people in all Military Special Programs.... Left behind.  Like the Old Shoe... Johnny: "Good Old Shoe"... 
They look stupid.
Better.
You like it?
Jim Belushi...?
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
The hats.
...of kittens...
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
...gotta read my reports.
Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
He never told me...
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Obviously...
Are you with me Buddy?
Excuse me.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
Would you like a closer look?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Come on.
Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
Maybe before the event, never after.
I'll come back all the time.
What does she look like?
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
Your friend saw them.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
What do you think?  Guess.
Who's that?
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
Who?  Your husband?
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
You must have been very proud.
I should be going anyway.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
He was so pissed.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
She's making this up.
I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
It's niiice.
...no...no...no...
Please.  That's all I need.
M-E...
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Something was there.  You saw it.
No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Three o'clock.
Not the focus.
I know.
Mmm.
Tomorrow.
After that.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Did you call the police?
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Norman...
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Sabotage?
Sweetheart--
Really big bed.
Call ya later.
We walked all night...
Not personally.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Yes.  The ghost.
...I'm positive this time...
...Please stop...
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
That's not what I'm sayi--
I'm not going to listen to this.
We don't know that for sure.
She's gone.
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
Mauduh...
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
Two what...?
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
Nothing was ever more false.
Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
He made that quite clear, yes.
When did she die...?
I had you sent away.
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
There are things I have to know!
It wes a dream...!
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
Now, lasher - it is our time.
FAST.
Like this...?
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
If that were true, I would not be here.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
I LOVE him!
I love Michael...
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
My jury's still out on that,
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
The one time I want it to work...
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
Rowan...?
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
Let's see.
I love you too.
I don't know.
A bit much.    Lucas.
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
On which planet...?
Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
I like him.  He can stay.
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
And it can't be forged?
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
All the time?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
I'm sorry?
I'm a dentist
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know...
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
Why not? Please - it would help me
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Then make it stop...
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
I am sorry...
WAIT FOR WHAT!?
Oh...
Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Maybe he got promoted.
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
Not ever. Never.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
Let me get this straight...
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
Well. The prom's coming up.
That was code for "I like you."
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
Dad, please.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
Some of them have to be automatics.
I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
It's not up to me.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
I miss them, too.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
I'm very aural.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Not a chance.
You're quick. I like that.
You think you're working with chimps here?
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
I'll make you very proud.
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
You called the cops on us?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
I have only one concern...
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
Tipping?
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
That's perfect.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
I'd like that.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
Then what?
No.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
The skinny brunette.
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
Where's the body?
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Why is that?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
So you were alone.
Yes.
And what do they say?
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
What brain?
Where, the mall?
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Why can't you come...
God, I've been calling you.
Duquette.  Forget him...
And you believe her?
Okay.  I love you too.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
What's that supposed to mean?
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Just like that?
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
That's cop bullshit.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
"Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Hey, I tried the board.
What way is that?
You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
Of course not.
I'm sure we will.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Yes sir.
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Philistine.
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
What is Tir Asleen?
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
Why not?
Madmartigan.
I will!  But I need help!
As above, so below.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
That's all I ever wanted!
Why?
He never misses.
Shut up.
I don't know much about him.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
I've seen pictures.
Not one this big.
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
Just do it!
Yes, sir.
Pick up the hat.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Okay, Mr. Book.
You don't say.
What are you going to do?
You have no right to keep us here.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
You couldn't wait until morning?
I was wrong.
No, no doctor...
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
Something wrong with buttons?
Anything against zippers?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
You're so sure of that?
I didn't even know about it.
Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
Say again?
Probably.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
I don't know where he is.
John said you're Amish.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
His name is John Book.
They don't have any shit.
You might have killed him!
No... No. It is just the English way.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
If she?
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Oh!
Hickory!
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
I have?
Whenever you wish.
Why --
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Oh, you....
Oh...
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
I knew you would!
Oh, my!
No, but you tried to.
The nerve.
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Don't push!
We do.
To Oz?
Let's.
Yes.
Oh --
Yes.
You promised us real things -- a real...
But I still want one.
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
We cant.
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
The inside man?
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Indeed.
Consider me ungrateful.
You knew him well?
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
You turned Renard.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
How would you know?
Still no contact yet.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
I would like to use the bathroom --
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
You're the only human being I care for.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Cured, yes.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
The missing scientists.
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --

I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Memory lane.
You and me.
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Isn't it true that you --
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Looks like a diner.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Who says you're the good guys?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
Naturally.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
You do everything Yorgi says?
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
You don't have to do that.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
They come in any other styles or colors?
You're joking, right?
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
Why you dogging me up?
Been to any good diners lately?
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
... until he found tungsten.
I don't like him being here.
What are you talking about?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
I wanted to talk to you.
Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
Sure you are, sport.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
Suit yourself.
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
It does indeed, Max.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Yes, my dear, he is.
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
I did, sir.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
I...
Of course.
Yes, don't worry.
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Is it worth taking a chance?
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
That's my good boy.
This is the only library I know of.
Will there be anything else?
Yes, sir.
I beg your pardon?
Nineteen, sir.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
What wockers?
What are you doing here?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Could be worse!
Why?
This guy means business.
What?
Who are you talking to?
Don't fall for that one.
Why?
That's what we're paid for.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
Ja, ja.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Are you serious??
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
But, after all, you have yours.
And I have mine.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
Four
Do you have a reservation?
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
